5: i reviewed this jerky for my website and really was amazed by the texture i do eat meat and jerky and am not a mock meat fan by any means but you could seriously slide this jerky by any meateater it had a great texture  nice pull good chew  but it wasnt the least bit tough as some jerky can be it is also rich in protein 13g per ounce a good option for vegetarians and vegansbr br i waivered on giving it 4 or 5 starts because it isnt a food i would eat regularly since the main ingredients are wheat gluten and soy flour  two foods we try to limit in our household but since this is my personal ingredient preference and no reflection on the taste and texture of this product i devoured it in about 2 minutes i didnt mark it downbr br also the teriyaki flavor is quite savory and a touch salty not sweet as many teriyaki jerkys tend to be i think this was a nice change
5: i got the sampler pack first and tried to find the one i liked best  i really like the texture of this jerky as its more like the real thing  i also like primal jerky so i tend to go from one to the other as they are both so different  primal is softer and more oozy  difficult to eat on the run as the package can be hard to open  this jerky is easy to throw in a ziploc and its not messy in the least  its got a good flavor but its really the texture that does it for me
4: this is great vegan jerky but it diappears quickly  it is not as hard to chew as the beef jerky that i vaguely remember
5: i purchase these unsalted dry roasted peanuts from this company on a regular basis for use in making candies ive had absolutely no problems with the product or the shipments
5: this is real licorice not the licorice flavored candy you get in us supermarkets  the flavor is very strong compared to what you find in the supermarket and it is more dense and chewybr br if you love licorice you will love thisbr br this finnish licorice is not salty
5: great stuff  true licorice with molasses  these are a good value however i noticed that the bars went up in price since i put them in my cart  im just too slow to order i suppose
5: i bought a few bags for my husband along with other brands  we are looking to buy bigger quanties of tubis  this licorice is simply the best  wonderful taste of licorice  not over powered with anise but wonderful molassestrue licorice
3: i usually buy panda licorice i liked this one because it was organic and came in a pack of 12 which made it a very good value the taste was ok but the crunch was too hard and too sticky
5: best licorice on the market  i dont normally like licorice but i was looking for organic products that i could eat and this stuff is good  normally when i think of licorice i think of real sticky or overly chewy  this is really tasty and has just the right tecture  if i had to nit pick i would say that the pakaging could be of the new aluminum bags that a german company develops that is nonplastic because plastic may not be safe for packaging food products but as far as whats available i recomend it with the highest rating  no cancer causing anticaking agents that they use in salt at least thats what der label says  again it has the highest standard of organic which is usda certified  placing 2nd order
3: this licorice has quite a strong anise flavorbr br and the texture is not as soft as the licoricebr br made by rj it is a nicequality product thobr br altho the box does not clearly state it the shelf lifebr br is 2 years from the stamped date on the box and packagesbr br having said this the rj wins my vote
5: tubis organic licorice was so soft and fresh perfect bitesized pieces very tasty  these made great stocking stuffers in their individual bags  yummy
4: tubis licorice was really good  its hard to find organic treats to give my kids that they like as well as the gmo corn syrupy garbage found in the candy isle of the grocery store  tubis is a good option
1: sorry it was terrible i actually threw it all out i couldnt even give it away
2: the photo of the bottle of kimchee base is misleading in real life they are tiny the description does not indicate how many ounces there are in each bottle so i was duped for the record each bottle is only 67 ounces i received three tiny bottles in this order when i did the math for the purchase price including shipping i paid 175 per ounce this stuff isnt gold this is the first time that i have felt ripped off with an amazon purchase bummer
5: spicy and delicious i always say for this product love it whoever packed this product did it with pride  kimchee is easy to make
5: this cookie spread is smooth creamy and delicious  ive only eaten it out of the jar but i think it would be tasty on a bagel toast or cracker  this tastes like creamy shortbread cookies heaven
5: loved this on a bagel or toast sweet and tasty for those of us who are not peanut butter fans
4: it is difficult to write this review since i had a somewhat mixed experience
5: ive tried both the smooth  the crunchy versions my very favorite is the smooth this is a wonderful treat one that i always have on hand
5: i had some biscoff cookies on a flight and loved them i wasnt sure i could find them in my area so i checked on amazon and found these spreads as well long story short the spreads have the great taste of the cookie they are almost too good because it is hard to resist nibbling them ive put them on toast on english muffins and even just from a spoon before you know it the jar is empty
5: this disappears faster  than pbbr if you havent tried itdobr even the crunchy is a unique experience for the taste buds
3: i love this product and have found numerous ways to us it i think my favorite is on ice cream i like that you only have to use a little i prefer the crunchy i guess i like the texture  but the price i paid i found out later is appalling i can get the same jar at walmart for less than 4 a jar so i am very disappointed that the great deals i usually find on amazon did not play out with this product in fact i kinda feel like i was ripped off
4: i love valrhona chocolate my mother is from the town in france where they are made so i grew up with it  i have lived in the us for 10 years now and used to buy them from the brand us online store with coupons found online there the bag is 22 lbs and is branded valrhona  go there to see what i mean i didnt take a picture of my last bag directly from thembr from this seller the bag is 2 lbs by the look of the package the difference in weight and the look of the feves  see my picture they are not in the best shape i am guessing this seller buys in bulk real bulk maybe 2nd choice feves even and then repackagesbr all in all the chocolates taste fantastic as i expect from valrhona but i admit i was expecting the brand package and look of the feves if you intend them for baking absolutely no issue if you intend them as treats next to your coffee then they are not looking their bestbr dont get me wrong for the price i paid less than at valrhona i will buy again soon and often its just that because i know what the brand package looks like i was a little disappointedbr caraibe is one of my favorites too they have different ones which i also buy
5: ordering with this seller is a must i ordered some valrhona chocolate and since i live in florida i was a little afraid that my chocolate melted by the time it was delivered not at all the packaging has a very good protection with ice bags and special paper so my chocolate was still a little bite cold when i opened it the valrhona chocolate is different from all the others since it has a true flavor not fat just right unique yes its more expensive but if you want to impress cook with it
5: i tried these out because a friend told me he buys them regularly  they are amazing  they are as good as the japanese steakhouse where i love to eat
2: disappointing purchase  the two packages i opened had all the noodles fell apart into many tiny pieces in the water  ive bought these noodles before and never had this happen  im guessing this had to do with damage during shipping
1: these have to be the worst noodles i have ever eatenudon or otherwise like others have said these broke into pieces were not thick like udon should be and tasted terrible traditional no way i got these thinking that since they were organic they would be of good quality what a crock now im stuck with these things that i wouldnt feed to a dog im never buying roland anything again
5: the noodle does not look like the regular undon which is thicker and rounder this looks like the lo mein style noodle which is flat and thinner it tastes good with the flavor and texture between udon and lo mein noodle the package arrive in good shape with fast delivery
5: not only are these noodles delicious they fit exactly into a regular saucepan 2qt without having to break them in half
5: love these noodles  buy them in bulk and save save save  nice taste and texture they came unbroken and ready to cook so excuse me thats what im just about to do  enjoy
5: good product at a good price the texture is excellent cooks evenly living in the country far from a source of asian noodles this service is great now if they will start offering japanese spaghetti sauce   
1: these are absolutely awful and taste nothing like udon or any kind of noodle i think someone replaced the wheat flour with sawdust also they broke apart into small pieces in the water almost instantly which was a surreal and somewhat disturbing experience
5: our 12 year old aussieborder collie mix was eating what we thought was pretty good food but every night his gas just about killed us and we knew it had to be making his stomach hurt as wellso we switched to this food tried it out with the 4 lb bag and hes been great ever since its very pricey but well worth it he seems happier and i know we are
5: i have tried numerous dry foods with my std poodle blue buffalo and chicken soup for the soul to name a couple and he spat them out he was getting constant yeast growth in his ears even with daily cleaning having received a free sample of nutrisca at a pet fair and using it as treats i decided to try and see if hed eat it as a constant food since on nutrisca lamb and chickpea he has blossomed his tail is fuller didnt know it was sparse until i looked at a picture the yeast infections are cleared up and he actually chows down on every morsel and begs for more hes truly a wondermutt on nutrisca and im giving it 5 stars
1: the first bag was stale so i looked to see the expiration date there is none for some reason so i opened the otherssame thing going to use it this winter for birds outside
5: the no salt label caught my eye and i had to try this one smells and tastes great on your roast steaks and soups
4: fyi
5: this is my favorite baby food line by far they are consistent and readily available at just about any store we got this variety pack on amazon after already purchasing it from local stores this is a great price compared to most stores and the variety of flavors is great i wish they had more variety packs available for stage 3 but compared to other products out there it is hard to complainbr br now i am just waiting for the day that earths best moves away from glass jars our daughter has started grabbing these out of her diaper bag and if she drops them on our hard floors it will break the jars i have broken a couple myself dropping them from the cupboard on to the granite counter tops i really like the pouches that some lines are doing and even the plastic containers that gerber does glass is great because it is recyclable but so are the plastic ones if you live in an area that supports that or you can reuse them like we do for storing bulk spices that is the only the con i have and it is not even big enough to rate this product any lowerbr br for those of you that cannot tell what flavors you are getting they are
5: our son is now 11 months old and weve been using this brand since he started baby food the taste is as close to the real thing as possibly other brands seem watered down compared to earths best the texture is smooth and flavorful i like that they have a large variety of healthy options that combine a whole variety of fruits vegetables whole grains and meats in my opinion there is no nutrition in mac and cheese so why bother giving it to them they have different stages that seem to have been very appropriate for the eating abilities of my son
4: the soup variety was tastycountry vegetable split peacarrot sweet potato cinnamon and squash bisque my daughter really seemed to enjoy it the split pea and country vegetable varieties had nice soft pieces of carrot in there that my baby could chew the sweet potato cinnamon bisque and squash bisque were thinner but you can always add small pasta or cereal very convenient and flavorful for young palates
5: my wife and i love these and more importantly so does our daughter  they have a good texture that lets her practice chewing with her limited teeth  i like that theres nice mixes of flavors not just creamed peas or pureed spinach but chunky mixes of vegetables and meat broth the first time we ordered these it took a while for them to come but the next two times they were sent right away  the food is actually good enough that i would eat it with a little salt  its also nice that we can donate the bottles to our local art teachers for use in their projects
5: our son is now 11 months old and weve been using this brand since he started baby food the taste is as close to the real thing as possibly other brands seem watered down compared to earths best the texture is smooth and flavorful i like that they have a large variety of healthy options that combine a whole variety of fruits vegetables whole grains and meats in my opinion there is no nutrition in mac and cheese so why bother giving it to them they have different stages that seem to have been very appropriate for the eating abilities of my son the soups served as a great transition to table food it has bite size soft pieces of vegetables and meats in a smooth baby food broth similar to consistency of regular babyfood
5: i have taste tested these foods and they are pretty good but of course i dont like to pile on the salt and its organic  i dont like to feed my baby other than earths best
5: ive become a earths best mom due to the good deals ive found that its the best value for your money i find the other brands doesnt offer the variety as earths best my son simply loves it
2: we are big fans of earths best food  but my daughter really hates all the flavors in this pack  i tried them and dont blame her
3: my son liked the oatmeal and fruit ones but gagged with the meat ones thats ok though i think any jarred smashed meat is probably disgusting good packaging fast arrival
5: love the ingredient list checked at all the stores in my area and could not get this item at all much less at the price i got if for here
5: my son loves this food  he is 16 months now and i still use them  not all the time but often  the reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain  he wont eat much when hes in pain but these are easy on his gums  they are organic and a quick meal  my son is strong and a very healthy weight  i make sure he gets as much organic wholesome food as possible  buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money  he loves the whole line
5: i like that it is organic and doesnt taste bad  i recommend this food because gerber just doesnt cut it for me i like earths best food combinations
1: my son has eaten the earths best fruits and veggies in the past and loves them so i thought id try the soups  epic fail  he generally will try anything and will even eat a few things hes not a total fan of  ive never seen him actually spit food out and continue to spit to get the taste out of his mouth  once i realized what he was doing i got him some water  needless to say this happened with each of the soups we tried
4: at first i loved earths best and it was about all i would buy they dont taste bad and i love that they are organic but for stage three they are just not textured enough all they have is a few chunks of carrot here or there i will say that for the price and the size of each jar there is still a value here and i will most likely stick to eb for stage 2 fruits but other than that i prefer sprout baby food it may be twice the price but in a chicken dish the first ingredient is chicken and i can honestly say i think it tastes good
5: i dont know how everyone else got these broken but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap not a single jar was broken  my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all
4: i like the soups for my daughter but as a stage 3 food i was hoping for a little more of a thicker consistency  you can really use this in stage 2 if you wanted because it is pretty thin  i love earths best products though and would recommend them
5: great price great ingredients and great food when we stepped up to these stage3 chunky foods our 9month old loved it she was literally screaming and laughing for the chicken and stars highly recommend this great organic food
2: i really like earths best baby foods and amazon but these jars were packaged so that glass touches glass this may not be worth the good pricebr  the jars arrived all wrapped up in bubble wrap but 2 of the 8 jars were broken inside  it was a big mess to clean up the broken glass and baby food  also per the amazon return policy grocery items are not returnable
4: my son loves these soups particularly the butternut squash bisque im a little confused that other reviewers said it lacked texture for a stage 3 food it is soup people not even adult soup is necessarily chunky i think its a great transition from stage 2 to 3 i would also say that babies on stage 2 could probablyhandle these items
4: my son really enjoys these flavors and the texture everytime i have ordered baby food it arrives very well packed in bubble wrap some of these combinations are hard to find and stores adn much more expensive
5: we love earths best  it was some of the only baby food my son would eat and the soup varieties are a nice option for something different than your standard fruits and veggies
4: i like that ist organic good price here on amazon the food should be thicker since it is stage 3 but its kinda runny
5: my 10 month old loves these they are his favorite i wish i could find lasagne or spaghetti in earths best but no luck so far the apple cinnamon oatmeal is what got him eating breakfast i like the chunkiness too he cant chew too much because he only has two little teeth but this food disolves and chews up easybr recommend for anyone
3: i like all of the food in this combo except for strawberry and banana  that does not seem like stage 3 food to me  it is very thin and runny  a food with this consistency does not belong with the others in this combo  i really really wish they would include a chunkier version  its enough to make me look into buying all the other foods in this pack individually  otherwise this food is great and ive had no trouble with broken jars but im really frustrated by the runny strawberrybanana and its enough to make me give 3 stars instead of 5 since it ruins the combo pack for me
5: earths best is the best my son enjoys eating it  i had a hard time getting my son to eat certain veggie from other brands i did not want him to not limit him to just orange colored veggies as he wanted honestly tasting some of the other brands green veggies i can understand why he didnt like them  i searched a few brands and we both like earth best the most  he eats his green veggies without gagging and even eats meat now  i could not get him to eat any other brand of meat  he loves it nowbr great brand and i trust it as a parent that i am givin him quality food
2: warning
1: i was disappointed to find out that the lids of earths best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains bpa
1: if you are looking for vegie soups thats not it all the items here have chicken added to it additionally this particular earths best product is not kosher
1: i have been very happy with earths best baby food and my son loves them i have a hard time finding a variety of flavors at the stores in town so i decided to order them unfortunately the broke during shipment when they arrived and i opened the box i found a soggy cardboard pack of jars i was afraid to even remove that plastic wrap to see which jars had broken or survived i didnt want to risk spreading broken glass so earths best food i am happy with ordering the jars online not so great i suggest sticking with the pouches when ordering baby food
1: i was really disappointed to find out that lids of earths best foods contain bpa i tried to contact company and ask them why they use bpa by the way bpa is not used in canada and europe for baby food but they did not contact me bpa has estrogenic effect what can be the cause of obesity there is evidence that bpa has effects on fetal and infant brain development and behaviorbr food itself is ok but i can not understand how they can risk ours baby life and health by using bpabr definitely we should do something with that
1: so we got this because its organic lots of veggies etc all the things we think we should feed the baby but unfortunately it was a total waste of time and money  my son would not eat it  at all  this is a little guy that will eat almost anything  hes really not that picky at all if you saw him youd know hes not thin  but he would take a bite of this and spit it out resulting in a lot of laundry and a lot of clean up in the kitchen  i smelled and tasted it myself and would have to agree that its pretty gross and since we were stuck with this huge box of it i tried everything mixing it with fruit dipping fruit  bread anything into it and he would not eat it  the earths best jarred foods has a strange chemically taste  smell to it  my son had no problem with any of the plum foods and i guess thats what were sticking to now  and to be honest the plum tastes better to me as well
1: my husband went to the store for me and purchased this soup not noticing it had a different label from regular campbells chunky chicken corn chowder it was absolutely terrible it was runny very few vegetables and almost no chicken the base was flavorless if anything like the other reviewer i didnt finish it either it was beyond bland and i dont see how they can call it chunky when there was such a lack of anything to it plus the base was thin as waterbr my favorite comfort food is the regular campbells chunky corn chowder that one has a thicker more flavorful base and is full of chunks of vegetables and chickenbr this healthy choice version was as if they had taken the regular version and added 2 cans of water
1: i picked up a can of this soup because it sounded interesting but i was very disappointed the base was really bland i was thinking it would be sweet because of the corn but it wasnt the chicken was okay but the carrots were mushy and the celery was cut too big and was bitter i didnt even finish it and definitely wont be buying it again
5: gotta disagree with another reviewer i have tried dozens of chicken soups over the years and this is one of my faves but it all comes down to personal taste doesnt it
4: br stashs wild raspberry caffeine free herbal tea is strong and fruity great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus which i do it contains hibiscus orange peel lemongrass rosehips natural raspberry flavor licorice powder and citric acid the package says it also contains soy but that makes little sense to me you should know this though in case you are allergic it is a fine tasting herb teabr br if you like a more subtle tea you may not be crazy about wild raspberry but if you like celestial seasonings and other commercial teas i think that this is a good one the reason i gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isnt as pure as it could be contains additives and flavorings and i can tell i prefer a more subtle tea and i save five stars for the very best teas ive tried but for those of you who like a lot of flavor and cant taste the additives its just finebr br recommendedbr 
5: these are great for training because you can break them into small bits since they are so soft  some of my dogs can be picky but theyve never turned down one of these
5: im using these with my 10week old siberian husky and shell do just about anything for me if i have one in my hand
5: just brought home a young apbt from the human society hes lovely and wants to learn but finding treats that grabbed his attention was difficultbr br bottom line is he goes nuts for these im working with him to get over triggers he has while were out for walks mostly going insane around other dogs and crying yelping and eventually full on barking with serious leash tugging im invisible when he goes into this freakout state however with a little work the treats grab his attention and bring the focus back to me i expect within a few months to have him totally over this problem and im relieved to find a treat that can help get him over this problem with lots of diligent trainingbr br thanks tillman you beautiful skateboarding pooch
5: i received a free bag of these when i went down for the westminster dog show this past february until then id not heard of this brand my dogs just love them they stay soft unlike other soft treats that harden up after the package has been opened they are also soft enough to easily break into smaller pieces for training treats my dogs and i prefer these to anything weve bought in the grocery store
5: these are great for training you can break them up into smaller pieces they are also soft which is great for teething puppies the beef ones are my dogs favorites
5: my dogs love these training treats  i break them up even smaller to use as rewards  they are soft which i like when training  my dogs get excited and sometimes choke on the hard treats  ive tried all the flavors and my dogs love them all  i use these as my main training treat because they dont have any unhealthy ingredients
5: these training treats are just right  weve been using them for a couple of years our dog mocha loves them they are easy to break into smaller pieces and easy to handle
5: these training treats work pretty good to reward my dog i have used the chicken lamb and beef so far and my dog eagerly eats them these are moist squares of treat i cut the squares into four smaller squares if you bend it with your fingers it will break in two but not as evenly as cutting it with a knife i will buy more when i need them i bought a couple packs of them the bag that they come in is resealable so i carry the bag in my waist pack so i can quickly reward my dog for wanted behaviorbr br i cut my package of natural balance training tips into 152 smaller squares the original square size is less than the size of a quarter coin but about that size in area
3: i saw this is a good brand so i bought it but i dont think this is a good training treat i bought every flavors they have because i was afraid if my puppies would get bored i still prefer wellness puppy treat wellness treat is softer and taste better i guess from the reaction of my poochies oh i forgot to mention that i have 2 small puppies who are morkie and maltese they are finicky eaters they eat this natural balance treat but just one piece and turn their faces away however when i show them just the package of wellness treat they sit even before i tell them to they both go crazy when they just smell the wellness treat from far awaybr goodluck
5: all my dogs love these treats  i looked tillman up online and turns out hes the worlds fastest skateboarding dog  i think that is so cool  i even found videos of him online  tillman is awesome and so are these treats
5: my dog has an extremely sensitive stomach so i have to be very careful what she eats  she loves these  and they are so great as treats for training
5: my dog adores these treats  the 1 squares are easily broken into smaller pieces for training and are sure to hold your dogs attention  they also fit into the two rubber treat ball toys i have to keep my dog busy trying to get them out
5: my dog likes the natural balance training tips they are moist yet break a part if needed i cut each square into four parts though lately ive just started to tear off a bit for training my dog likes these training tips as long as i dont give him them every day so i also give him another jerky treat some of the time i dont rely only on food training treats to train i also use a tennis ball as he likes the balls usually more than the food treatsbr ive just ordered two kong rubber nontoxic balls for my dog as the felt on the tennis balls can hold onto abrasive debris the natural balance training tips are my dogs favorite food treat more than any of the others ive tried he likes the chicken and beef the most
4: very fortunate that it workedworks for me i took one capsule every time i pumped it did the job i pump exclusively and make sure to do it at least every three hours for 10 minutes im able to produce approximately 30 ounces per day i only took it for three days straight now i take a couple whenver i see my supply diminishing
4: they handled the product in a professional manner the product was as listed and fresh i would do business again with them
5: bought these when my supply was going down with my firstborn and seemed to work for me and her i didnt care for taste i guess you can call it but once you get past that its great
5: i am a working mother and have been pumping milk for my daughter for over 6 months i have gotten busier and busier and became concerned when my milk began to taper i use these supplements every time i start to see a lull in my milk supply i usually take one a day at night and use them during the day if i plan on pumping regularlybr br i do not take a whole lot of it just enough to keep myself pumping between 10 and 13 oz per day it has worked wonders for me i only wish i had this after my son was born my milk dried up really quickly when he was around 8 months and he had to drink frozen for the remainder of his first year luckily my daughter will have much more milk due to this product i would recommend it
5: ive relied in this the whole time i wad breastfeeding my baby for 7 months i was able to pump 4 times a day with 56oz per pumping because of fenugreek i took a total of 12 capsules a day the health store lady says it was ok to do so and was fine the whole time i took it
5: my doctor recommended this supplement  it seems to really help me so i hope it will also help you as well  this supplement is worth the money
5: as an extended breast feeding mom i found my milk supply was gradually waning  this product helped boost my supply within a couple days  i did find it easier to take after i had eaten though and with lots of water
3: i started taking this when my baby was about 10 months  i have been trying to make it to one year nursing  i didnt see a great increase maybe a little  it certainly didnt hurt anything to try it  i have now stopped taking it and didnt see any difference when i stopped either  i think its something to try if you are really wanting to continue nursing and see a decrease in your production
5: it worked so well and have been using it for months highly recommended and have already bought 5 bottles of it i would recommended this to anyone who is breast feeding and sees a decrease in milk production after few months especially after 3 months or so great product for the price and stands by its claim
5: this is a great product i use a lot plan on buying more will buy more as i need them  quick shipping also
5: i started taking three capsules three times a day less than a week ago and my milk production has almost doubled i take it with two capsules of blessed thistle as well this has been like a miracle for me my milk decreased after going back to work and i was getting so frustrated and defeated im so glad i tried this i also got a new set of shields for my pump that fit better try this combination if youve seen your milk production decrease it works
5: these capsules are excellent to increase the milk supply i felt a reduction in my milk supply after i joined workbr i asked my peditrician and he suggested to take fenugreek capsules i ordered these from amazon and they are awesomebr after a week of use i see my supply has increased
3: i purchased this item because my obgyn recommended it in order to help increase my milk supply while breastfeeding she recommended taking the regular dose for 5 days to increase milk production the capsules were easy to take and they had a pleasant smell but they didnt help increase milk production after taking for 10 days straight
3: to be honest i was hoping for the results that some women that reviewed these pills had  i think that i had some milk increase but nothing like what i had read on most of the reviews  i tried pumping every two hours after returning to work and would be lucky if i pumped 225oz total from both breasts i thought that meant that i had a milk supply problem so i started taking fenugreek  when i first started taking the pills i was only taking two twice a day  that seemed to help a little and the morning pump i was pumping about 4oz each breast  i slowly increased the amount of pills i was taking but it didnt seem to increase my milk supply  i pump twice a day now and get anywhere from 1012oz total for the daythat might get my baby through one day at day carebr br i think that this just works differently for different people  i did notice that when i sweat i smelled like maple syrup but that has since decreased and i dont notice it anymore  i might have become more gassy but it never affected my baby in a negative wayshe has always remained a happy baby whether im taking it or not  im still taking the pills a few times a day and just pump twice a day for whatever i can get  i have started supplementing my baby now almost 5 months to start weaningbr br i would recommend fenugreek if you think that your milk supply is low and you need a boostit doesnt seem to hurt to try it  i wished that i would have gotten what other women got pumping 810oz per breast every pumpbut alas i wasnt that lucky
3: i pump then bottle feed my baby the breast milk i began taking this as directed 2 pills3x a day and was able to pump about 23oz of milk each time i pumped every 3 hours on each side when i noticed my baby started needing more i began taking 3 pills3x a day and now get about 34oz each time i pump still every 3 hours on each side i gave it 3 stars because my hope is i wont have to keep increasing the dosage just to pump more anyway it seems to be working out ok so far hope this review helps
5: i am a pharmacist and therefore very skeptical on herbal products that are not regulated by the government however this natures way fenugreek did really work in increasing my milk supply
5: i take 4 caps 4 times a day along w mothers milk tea and have more than doubled my milk supply  much cheaper here than what i had been paying at a local health foods store
4: i took the pill 3x3two days only but had to stop because my baby started having runny stool  like diarrhea  i wish i could take it longer to see if it worked or not so keep an eye on your baby  you dont want her to get diarrhea  unfortunatey it could be one of the side effects
3: i think this was starting to work but it made my daughter spit up all the time  more milk plus from mother love worked much better for me and for her
5: super easy cheap way to increase milk supply ive used it at various points with two babies and always saw a modest increase in milk production  especially useful when i went back to work since the pump is not as effective in triggering milk production as the baby
4: i wanted to breastfeed my son as long as possible but i felt my supply was diminishing after only three months and several sources pointed me to try fenugreek capsules i ordered them and before i received them i was supplementing one feeding a day with formula after i started taking them i noticed that i was able to pump more and my son seemed less hungry the one catch to this is that i was also drinking more fluids and pumping frequently also to help increase my supply so im not 100 sure that it was because of the fenugreek but there was a definite correlation there they taste kind of funny sort of like maple syrup and gel capsules are a little weird but well worth it for the health and financial benefits of exclusive breastfeeding
4: i purchased this after my lactation consultant recommended it to increase my milk supply after a decrease  i definitely recommend this and it did work for me  my milk supply doubled within about 4 days
5: i started taking this to boost my breastmilk supply so i could pump more i noticed a difference within the first 24 hours and was satisfied there was no downside when i stopped taking it no side effects to myself or my son while taking it and it actually calmed his reflux some the maple scent wasnt noticeable to anyone other than myself and went away when i stopped taking the supplement i recommend it to every nursing mom i know that thinks theyre having problems with supply
5: this helped increase my milk production as my pediatrician said it would  you will smell like fenugreek which is kind of maple syrupy kind of herbal smelling but its worth it  you should be taking two caplets two to three times a day so they will run out fairly quickly
5: my breastmilk supply is low and i tried this supplement and my milk supply doubled after a few days intake it works for me with no side effect at all but i have read some reviews that it does not work for every woman everyone reacts differently hope this helps you too
5: i am nursing twins and when we had to move for my husbands job from wa to la my supply took a little hit i got the fenugreek and took it for about 2 weeks 3 pills 3 times a day and my supply is way up i can pump 15 ounces at a time i dont know that everyone would get such massive results but if you are diligent with nursing pumping or a combo of both you can definitely increase your supply
5: i went back to work and started pumping when my baby was about 6 weeks old i pump three times a day at work and nurse at night at first i didnt have any problem got 4 oz each time but my milk supply began to decrease when my baby was about two months old so i searched on the internet and found this fenugreek but it took me a few weeks to decide to buy it i tried to eatdrink more but it didnt help i take two pills three times a day and saw a slight change on my milk supply on the second day it took about a week for me to really see a different now i get about 45 oz each pump works great i just wish i bought it a week sooner so my baby didnt have to take formula
5: i used it to boost my milk supply and noticed a significant increase in the first 24 hours pretty amazing stuff and smells great
4: took over 2 weeks and gradually increasing intake to 4 pills 3x a day but definitely helped my supply
5: i had trouble keeping up my milk supply at times and i choose to believe that these actually helped its a little annoying to have to take them all day long but i really do think it helped me out not bad tasting either
5: i sart using it to increase my supply and it did ntwo days i notice a great difference becase of the reviews i purchase it and it really works thanks i will buy again if needed
4: my doctor recommended that i try fenugreek to increase my milk supply within 24 hours i noticed an increase after about a week i was able to freeze one bag of milk every other day i am going to continue to take this supplement as i return to work to keep my supply up i take 2 capsules 3 times a day
5: i bought this to increase my milk supply and it works great i could do with out the syrup smell but oh well it works to make more milk
5: i am a nursing mother to a 12monthold and ive been taking this to increase my milk supply  within a day of taking it twice a day i did notice a slight increase but its nothing drastic  other than that i havent noticed any effects
3: i chugged down dozens of these capsules in the hope that theyd help with lactation  they may havebut not enough that i could say definitively  what really did help me surprisingly was massage  every time i had a massage milk volume tripled
3: while this product did increase my supply i went from pumping around 9 oz on both sides to 17 in about 5 minutes it ruined my daughter she was fine until i fed her the freshly pumped milk and she wouldnt drink over an ounce without fussing i fed her directly from my breast thinking maybe she just didnt want a bottles nipple and she ate a little more and fell asleep but then when she woke she screamed for hours as though she were in pain curled up turned red wouldnt sleep for longer than ten minutes and it took me half a day to realize the only thing i had done different was take four of the capsules i actually liked the maple syrup smell but she looked like she was in so much pain i just cannot give this a full five stars there should be something on the label that warns or more reviews about it
1: i tried this because i had been reading it would increase breast milk but it didnt do anything for me
5: who cares if you smell like maple syrup there are worse things you could be accused of smelling like  it brought my milk supply up safely so ill take itbr br beware the prescription galactogogues  they worked for me but had some side effects for me and baby and can have some longterm neurological side effects if taken continuously  i found when i stopped taking reglan my milk supply dropped off again  no way was i taking it again after the tummy aches my baby had the first time and certainly wouldnt take it continuously for the next several months until i reach my goal of one year  so i started taking fenugreek  it does the trick and i feel safe continuing it as long as needed  and i think i am the only one who can smell the maple syrup anyway i am the only one sticking my nose in my armpits  dont worry about it
4: i noticed an increase of milk production after a week of taking this supplement  i take four capsules three times a day along with blessed thistle 3 capsules 3 times a day  previously i pumped four times a day and got 12 ounces in total now i get about 15 ounces  the maple syrup smell is not overwhelming but it is easy to feel a bit lightheaded and nauseous from the effects on your blood sugar levels so i make sure to take my supplements after a meal  i also notice that the more water i drink and the healthier i eat during the day the more milk i yield in general  despite the good and the bad i will continue my pillpopping regiment because every ounce of milk for my baby is precious
5: i was adament about breast feeding my baby everything was fine while i was at home i had no problems breast feeding but when i had to go back to work i wasnt getting much through pumping i made sure to drink plenty of water and ate enough fruits and veggies but i guess some women dont produce a whole lot i tried the mothers milk tea first before ordering the herbs i took if for a week and didnt notice a thing i was depressed bc i didnt want to supplement but the demand was more than the supply i ordered the fenugreek and the blessed thistle i read other reviews saying to take both so i thought mindaswell after 1 day i was producing more before i would pump and get 1oz from one side and maybe nothing from the other now i get 34oz from each side per sittingpumping and while at work i try to pump every 2 hours its hard bc i am a hairstylist and usually very busy but i could care less what anyone says i have to feed my child so i go in the back and pump i do take 2 of each pill 3 times a day i do have to get up in the middle of the night and pump to relieve myself id say if you dont want to have to do that skip the 3rd dose but my son usually gets up once anyways to eat so i just pump what i can hope this helps it helped me so much
3: this has been a good product for me  it seems to be increasing my milk production but not by a lot  if you forget to take it once or twice your milk production will decrease again almost immediately  im glad i got this to help me get a little further with breast milk for my child but if your milk is pretty good and your not good at remembering to take pills i wouldnt bother
5: i am 40 and just had my son 5 months ago  started having trouble with my milk supply around the 5 or 6 week mark  due to a few different issues  didnt discover this until a few weeks after than and took 2 pills three times a day and drank lots of water  it immediately increased my supply  over time however my supply has decreased again even with continued use went back to work so i am no longer able to breastfeedpump every 4 hours  only every 68 now  i must admit that i think the fenugreek is the only reason i am even pumping the 1216 ounces a day that i get now  i am now going to try combining the fenugreek with blessed thistle as some other users have posted about  hopeful it will increase my supply again
3: everyone said to try fenugreek to increase lactation  i took it several 34 times per day for about 5 days  i didnt notice any increase  maybe it is just my system  the label interestingly does not claim to improve lactation  maybe it is just a popular wives tale that it does
5: my wife used this to increase her milk supply towards the end of nursing and it far surpassed any expectations
5: i love this product it is excellent it increased my milk supply rapidly i noticed an increase in one day i usually am skeptical about products like this but when i saw that my milk supply was not enough for my baby i turned to other measures
4: it seems to work not sure if it is my pump working good to keep up my milk supply or the fenugreek but it definitely makes my milk smell sweeter
4: it worked for me since the first day i started to use it i was getting 30 ml everytime but with fenugreek increased about 20 to 40 ml more wasnt a lot of milk but i can say it worked  i added a tea mothers milk and now my milk supply is even bigger so i guess pills plus tea works even better than only fenugreek pills good luck
2: i got these because i have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding moms i used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply but for the entire month my baby pooped 68 times a day she was fussy and always blowing out her diapers i didnt make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasnt as fussybr i was taking 2 capsules 3 times a day i barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable i was really hoping this would help but it just didnt work for me
5: fenugreek works for some moms and doesnt for others i find it utterly amusing that women talk about smelling like maple syrup while taking the supplement i havent noticed that  either im used to it or my husband is too nice to tell me or he has noticed and likes it i was making just enough to feed my little one and now i regularly pump 12 ounces after he eats and i pump in between feedings and get an ounce or so that doesnt sound like a lot but it adds up and ive started quite the nice freezer stash im not honestly sure if it was the fenugreek that has done it or if my body just started producing more because my diet is great and i stay hydrated but since fenugreek is a hell of a lot cheaper than the motherlove products and not as annoying with the restrictions about drinking around taking the pills im just gonna keep taking thembr also i have had no problems with gassiness in baby
5: i did some researching on how to increase my milk production and after reading several of the promising reviews for this fenugreek i thought id give it a try since it was so affordable i am a very skeptical person and was very surprised when i did notice more milk after just the first 2 days i at first took the recommended 2 capsules 3 times a day my daughter who was almost 3 months old didnt seem to be affected by it and i seemed to be able to keep up production i stopped taking them after about a week then when i would notice my milk going back down or my daughter seeming more hungry than usual i popped 3 capsules just a little while before needing more supply and saw that it helped to do that just once a day it has been wonderful that i can stop taking it and then take it when needed and know that it will work i did notice the maple smell in my sweat and urine though but thats something i can deal with knowing im able to feed my daughter without having to supplement with formula never noticed any other side effects now i just take them every few days as needed definitely worth trying if you are feeling the urge to supplement or give up breastfeeding altogether because of low production or just cant keep up with baby now if they can just come up with something to make both breasts produce equally
3: i used this for a month but not sure that it really helps me when my baby started to burp up milk i stopped using it to eliminate the cause i have not gone back to using the fenugreek because i now have more milk than when i was taking the fenugreek hence i am not sure whether this helps or not but i would not discourage people from using it since many of my friends have used it with successful
3: i think this product helped a little bit but the milk production slows down once you stop taking the vitamins
5: i noticed an immediate increase in supply when i started these suppliments  the only downside is that you smell like maple syrup and that gets annoying after a while
5: i started taking fenugreek when i went back to work  despite exclusively pumping since my baby was 6 weeks old fenugreek helped keep my milk production up  i was able to exclusively breastfeed my baby until she turned 13 months all with the help of my trusty pump and fenugreek
2: it barely gets your milk production up by taking the recommended dosage and if you try to take more like some people say to get it to work it can make you very sick to your stomach and you will spend more time on the toilet than pumping milk it also makes you stink like overcooked maple syrupbr id rather keep drinking my mothers milk tea and going to look for another supplement this is just too harsh for me
4: fenugreek seed does seem working for enhancing more milk have these capsules 3 times a day with lots of fluid
5: i used this when my milk supply started to dip if i took about 710 pills a day i would see an increase
5: i have been taking these pills because i am breastfeeding and wanted to increase my supply the price on amazoncom is great i will always come back here to order online instead of going to my local health store
5: works greatbaby loves itit seems like im always full now
1: i purchased the product to give me relief with my pms and diabetes but it is also for women who are breastfeeding so it also causes your breast to become larger and that is something i dont need so i wasted my money buying something i cant use
1: my wife finished all 100 pills in the bottle and it did not increase her milk production at all save your money and spend it elsewhere
5: my daughters doctor gave me ricinus communis pellets you can order them on here comes in a blue container  you take 5 pellets under the tongue 3 times a day for 3 to 4 days and you will increase supply quickly  i noticed day 2 an increase  these are better than fenugreek wont cause any side effects in the baby either
3: i just finished taking this along with the blessed thistle and it did nothing for me all 100 pills nothing i guess everyting doesnt work for everybody its okthough because i will stop nursing my daughter when shes six months anyways in about a month i did like the fact that i smelled like maple syrup weird but true
4: i noticed a small difference in the amount but not as much as i wanted and it comes with the price of smelling like maple syrup
2: i had read in a health magazine that fenugreek was a product that could help enlarge the breasts i didnt even get to a point with prolonged use to dicover if that was true because these pills had such a funny taste to them and if you dont eat right away or right before you feel very sick and still sometimes after eating youll feel sick purhaps it was the size or the dose
5: im a guy and as most guys i appreciate bigger boobs my girlfriend who i have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change before considering surgery we decided to give some natural methods a try after doing some research we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazoncom since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before which didnt work we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results here is what we picked outbr a hrefhttp
1: bought this product to increase my milk supply after reading reviews but its just arrived and it says not suitable to take when nursing so now im not sure if its safe to take very disappointed
5: i read many diverse reviews for this product but i believe it only works if you use it properly i learned that it not only about taking a pill you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too i noticed as soon id start extracting or taking pills at different times milk amounts would start messing up so i started pumping 4 times a day every 6 hours day or night and it became stable and enough for a baby it is truth that pills give a gas not only baby but i was gassy too but i started taking smaller dose than written on package 4 pills a day every time id pump supply was still good but a baby wasnt as gassy later on as she got bigger it was unnoticeable rather id say it was due to a food pickles cabbage etc most importantly i believe breast feeding was more valuable over gas issue ive met so many women who were just too lazy to give their babies what is best for them
3: i cant really leave a fair review on this product because im not sure if it worked or not i paired it with mothers milk tea and didnt see any results but that could just be my own body
1: was intended to increase breastmilk and even advertised as a supplement to do so  nopenot at all didnt do any of that
5: i have wanted to increase my breast size for a long time i decided to try fenugreek  i was told to be patient results could take months  after taking two capsules three times a day for a little over a week i can already see noticeable results  i am ecstatic at the prospect of finally having the breasts i want i think that c cups are almost definitely possible
5: i prefer luvs over any other brand they have a powder scent and are the only diapers my petite daughter doesnt blow out of
1: buy it at your local grocery store you will get it at least 10 days sooner and with less stress
5: i had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply
5: my milk supply began to decrease significantly after i started back to work my son was about six months old at this time i took  and still take 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day if i am not able to pump i add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more to keep my milk supply going strong this is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished if stress schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way five stars for fenugreek and blessed thistle too as a side note the lactation nurses have told me that these herbs do lower your blood sugar so they should be taken with food i say that from experience all in all it more than met my expectations
5: my mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level it works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of glucophagebr the use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on wwwpubmedgov br br my mom gets it from the indian grocer where it is much cheaper though loose and not encapsulated
2: i was taking fenugreek along with alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and i the combo had then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable i suspected everything from my food to the supplements i tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change finally i decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20 of babies fenugreek causes gas andor fussinessbr br so the next day i stopped taking it now 1 week has passed and not only has my babys gassiness gone away i oddly feel that i have more milkbr br im sure this works for some so cant say its bad just be aware that this can happen
5: i had to decrease my babys feedings when i had to return to work 8 weeks postpartum eventually my hectic schedule and numerous illnesses made me stop my son is now 3 months and i have been feeling incredibly guilty about stopping so im attempting to relactate i only had about 2 drops of milk from each side but after almost a week of fenugreek 9 pills a day im noticing more droplets and an occasional squirt i find that incredibly impressive without this and my pump i would have given up and felt guilty for the rest of my life
5: fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselvesmuch less actually try it the fact that it contains phytoestrogens just complicates things further if youre concerned about testosterone levels but sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected waysbr br i started using fenugreek a year ago discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a cholinerelated medication i had just started since fenugreeks action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fearanxiety responses i thought it might help to defuse these reactions it was at least worth a shotbr br it does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions i combined it with lglutamine for those who are really interested what surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that i experienced inside of three days and when i went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek i found that a mid2011 report by australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek so objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real subjectively i know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boostsbr br and i wasnt even looking for this effect but it works and this is one of those sideeffects thats a keeper beyond this fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes it appears to help with bloodsugar levels but i cant say definitively that it works its inexpensive enough to be worth tryingbr br my hopedfor longterm use for fenugreek is actually to help with what buddhists call metta meditation that is focusing on lovingkindness research by the center for affective neuroscience at the university of wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and once again is closely associated with oxytocin my experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy this makes eminent sense lactation and motherchild bonding pretty much go hand in handbr br if youre interested in the underlying neurophysiology you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this if youre just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we cant figure out all the physiology involved even if none of the above effects interests you fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things such as digestion see wikipedia for more information on such usesbr br i hope some of this proves helpful
5: i wanted to switch my baby to formula but it gave her gastrointestinal problems i then decided to switch back to breastfeeding i had only stopped for about a week but my milk supply had significantly decreased i was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours my baby has a cleft palate so i exclusively pump because of this i am aware of exactly how much milk i am producing i ordered the fenugreek which arrived surprisingly fastand started taking it immediately the bottle suggests taking 12 pills 3x a day with food i started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions i did not notice a huge difference at first i read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day i increased my dosage after about a week of fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings i noticed a huge difference i would get approx 6oz every 3 hours my first pump in the morning around 5am i normally get about 10oz my freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent i now pump for 20 min every 45 hours with an 8 hour break at night my milk supply has not diminished and i am confident it is the fenugreekbr br i have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned i have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to fenugreek the only downside is that since i take 9 pills a day the bottle doesnt seem to last very long however fenugreek is super cheap so buying more isnt really an issue for me
5: our baby was born in early october my wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital she advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk we might try fenugreek a supplement available at healthfood stores of course we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter well my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the babys growing needs  we mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child the woman said she had the same problem and told us to get fenugreek she said it had worked for her there was that strangesounding word againbr br we purchased natures way fenugreek shortly thereafter strange stuff its an herbal supplement in capsule form but the label doesnt say what its for i guess you just have to know evidently its one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith anyway since we heard about it from two completely independent sources my wife started taking it well it wasnt a miracle there was no immediate change however my wife gradually began to keep up with the babys needs and has kept up ever since was it the fenugreek perhaps maybe she was just adapting to the new baby its hard to tell however if anyone is having this problem id say the fenugreek is worth a trybr br gary peterson
5: i was really skeptical at first a lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size after the first day my breasts started to feel heavier fuller and more firm i started at an acup and even with inconsistent use maybe 2 capsules a day or less i was reaching toward a ccup at the end of a couple months or so i would highly recommend this product cause it also helps with constipation too i stopped taking it orally because i noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts so at the moment im gonna try making a rub out of it so i can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage
5: ive been using fenugreek for about 2 weeks now  i love it  it works great  i bought fenugreek because im a working mom who pumps 23 times a day at work i was worried that i wouldnt be able to keep up with my babies needs because my first 2 weeks back at work the baby ate more at daycare than i could pump  within a few days of taking the fenugreek i was pumping more than he was eating  i no longer have fears that ill have to supplement with formula
5: i read on a breastfeeding website that you should take a bit more of this supplement than is listed on the bottles directions on day 1 i took 3 pills 3 times per day and the following day i pumped 6 more ounces of milk i took the same amount of pills the 2nd day and only 3 pills on the 3rd day on days 2 and 3 i didnt pump because i was at home but i was able to feed my baby without supplementing with formula it was a 5day holiday weekend and at no time did i need to supplement nor did i take any additional pills after those first 3 days after the 5day holiday i pumped 16 ounces each day for 2 days in a row and also breastfed my baby in the evenings when i got home from work with no problem that brings me to today and i am still going strong before that i was lucky if i pumped 912 ounces the side effects for me included that maplesyrup smell in urinesweat and it also upset my stomach but it was only for a few days so i thought it was worth it the best thing is that once your supply is increased you can stop taking the pills
1: i hate to give a bad review since i have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production which is why i purchased it i just feel the need to share that i took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction it was 2am and i went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts and chickpeas this is not marked anywhere on the label on amazons page or on natures ways website
5: this stuff did not do much to help me make more milk it did however make my boobs look bigger also me and my daughter smelled like maple syrup i could even smell it when i went to restroom if i wiped under my arms i smelled maple syrup i took 4 capsules every 8 hours i used the gnc fenugreek though i am waiting on my mothers milk tea to come in the mail i will be writing a review on that when i get it hope that works betterbr br updatebr i have noticed that when i take fenugreek or drink mothers milk tea my daughter gets baby acnereally small cluster of bumps on her back and legs nothing too scary i also noticed that when i take less fenugreek pills with mothers milk tea it does increase my supply it takes about 12 days to increase it i would go from 3 12 1 12on the right and 2 on the left ounces in one session all together from both breasts to filling a 4 ounce bottle almost to the top in one session this makes me very happy the only problem is that it still gives my daughter baby acne so i use every now and then hope that helps
5: in preparation for going back to work i was worried that i wouldnt be able to keep my breastmilk supply up to keep up with my baby  i tried motherlove more milk two alcohol free because motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet i got from my lactation consultant  it didnt work for me  so then i tried more milk plus alcohol free  that also didnt work for me  finally after talking to a couple of people they recommended fenugreek which i had read about before but wanted to give motherloves more milk product line a try because of all the great reviews i read  i ordered motherloves fenugreek and finally my breastmilk supply started to go upbr br before motherloves fenugreek i was pumping every 25 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total 1 to 15 oz on left side and 15 to 2 oz on right side  by the time i finished a 4 oz bottle of motherloves fenugreek i was still pumping every 25 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right sidebr br i was worried about keeping up with my baby but now my baby cant keep up with me  after using fenugreek for about a month ill have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and i now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer and running out of room to store any morebr br note
5: im a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work  despite pumping every three hours at work for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day i was starting to have to top off my babys bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash  at first it was an extra ounce a day then two then three  as any breastfeeding mother knows thats a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the futurebr br i decided to try supplementing with fenugreek but because i am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects i did a ton of research on the proscons of fenugreek before starting supplementation  my research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement  ive learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals  this way the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my systembr br the biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb  it is critical to take enough or you will not see any effect  some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day for a total of 6 pills a day  personally i had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day for a total of 9 pills a day to get the desired effect  also you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses  after a couple days of starting supplementation i saw an increase in my supply so i am now able to pump enough milk for my babys bottles during the day while i am at work  thanks to the fenugreek im getting a 23 ounce boost per day which is not a huge amount but its all i needed  good luck
5: i have not had any acid reflux since i started taking fenugreek herbal is the way to go if at all possiblei have tried tums and prilosec they just make me feel nausia or my mouth tastes like chalk with fenugreek you just take two pills befor each meal and no problems everything works diferently on different people but this is fairly cheep so youre not out much if it dosnt work for you
2: i am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months  i noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple  of people said to try this herbbr br as i said in the title i really would love to say it worked for me but after taking this product as directed in hopes of boosting my milk supply it failed to deliver  i am not saying it may not work for others  but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup and not in a good waybr br maybe it will work for you as it has for others
4: this is proven to be effective in increasing milk production when lectating in clinical studies you do need to take higher dose which is 2 tabs three times a day retail chain in my city the price was higher and pill count was lower so definately a good deal to buy from amazon i would highly recommend this for lactating mothersbr also diabetics can benefit from it too
4: i used this with both of my children when i went back to work and needed to pump enough milk  i couldnt stand the taste of the mothers milk teas so this was so helpful to me  it worked within 23 days  i did need to take about 810 capsules per day and i did smell like maple syrup fenugreek smells like maple and with such a high dose it does come out in your sweat but it was worth it  neither of my children seemed to noticemind so i dont think it changed the taste of the milk at all  i highly recommend this for any nursing mothers trying to increase their production
5: fenugreek is amazing  within 2 days my milk doubled and i was able to successfully nurse my onemonth old baby  we both smelled like maple syrup for a week but that was fine with me
5: i highly recommend this for anyone having problems with milk supply it takes about 2 weeks to start working
2: i read all the reviews of this product and couldnt wait to use it i took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy the doctor determined she had colic changed my diet added special formula  still was not producing enough breast milk and took me off all vitamins after a week she was becoming our happy baby again i started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again i immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal for some reason this product bothered her stomach i did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well
1: too bad they didnt work for me i took 3 pills 3 to 4 timesday for about 2 weeks with no results  in fact they seemed to dry me up more so i stopped using them  im going to try drinking more water and eating oatmeal
5: i ordered the supplement after realizing that pumping at work wasnt producing as much as i needed to cover what my 3month old daughter drank at daycare and im committed to exclusively breastfeeding for as long as the aap recommends  currently i take two capsules with every meal 6 a day  i began to notice increased engorgement probably about 48 hours after starting the supplement  since starting it ive been pumping about 34 ounces more per day which is enough to cover the gap i had been concerned about  although i myself was a bit gassy for the first few days i didnt notice any side effects in my daughter and i was definitely watching out for thembr br i should say i had to stop taking the pills for a few days due to some minor surgery and i did notice my supply go down again  so the pills do work but in my case at least i have to keep taking them to keep getting results  im happy to do it for my baby
5: a few weeks after my baby girl was born my milk started to decrease a girlfriend of mine told me about fenugreek to help increase my milk again i take 2 pills three times a day wow what can i say my cup runs over this is a great product to any mother and baby while nursing
4: i first tried fenugreek tea but even my husband who loves tea said it was nasty  my ob told me this would slighly help my milk production and she was right  i wouldnt say a lot but probably added an extra feeding or so 4ish oz to my day  i took 2 capsules 3x a day  the side effect that we heard about and laughed about was totally true  you will smell like maple syrup  its really odd and funny  i made all my friends smell me
5: my milk was slowly diminishing and i read that fenugreek helps  i works just taking 2 tablets 3xs a day and i can now nurse with an abundunce of milk  1 happy customer thanks
5: i used this herbal supplement to increase my milk supply when breastfeeding my first and second son  it helped me during a difficult and stressful time  worked great combined with blessed thistle
5: i was breastfeeding my twins and wanted a little help with milk production i used it for about 2 days and saw a significant increase i didnt notice any side effects but i didnt take really high doses either  i didnt need too i was able to produce enough for the twins up to 5 months without needing any supplements so it is not a situtation where i went from little production to a lot i was producing a lot of milk to begin with and the fenugreek helped increase it enough that i didnt have to supplement with formula untill 8 months
4: smells a lot like currythe capsules could be of better quality in terms of packaging  but this product absolutely works i have twins and i dont even take the capsules as often as recommended but i am seeing an increase in my milk production
5: i can honestly say that i noticed a significant difference in my milk production with 2 days of taking these pills almost everything i read from online resource sites kept saying to trust my baby and my body your body will produce what baby needs based on supply and demand this wasnt working out so great for me i breastfed full time from the day he was born and through his first month to establish my supply as the resources also stated as well as pumped on occasion even then however my baby would fuss at nearly every feeding especially when i had to feed on my right breast how could i be expected to relax and just let the milk slowly come drop by drop by drop while my son is all but crying from hunger with my nipple in his mouth it broke my heart these pills turned out to be a life saver now hes 7 weeks old and i can pump 45 to 7oz per session and still feed him within 2hrs of pumping with no problems as for that maple smell i havent experienced anything to that affect and most importantly  my baby is happy
5: i went to a breastfeeding class at the hospital where i delivered my son about 6 wks before his arrival in 2010  five years before i had nursed my twins but had given up at 10 wks due to not making enough milk  being totally exhausted from trying to keep up with both of them  i wanted to be more successful this round  the lactation nurse covered a bunch of details in the class but she specifically talked about some of the things moms could do to increase or maintain their natural milk supply  she recommended fenugreek as one of the supplements that could be used that worked for a many people  had essentially no sideeffects the only thing mentioned was that moms  babys urine might smell like maple syrup which doesnt seem like a deterant to me i started using fenugreek less than 12 hrs after the birth of our son  i used it until he was 12 months old because that is when i weaned him  i typically took two capsules at bedtime but if there were times i felt like my production was down i would take it more frequently throughout the day i have recommended this product for several friends  family members who have decided to breastfeed  will continue to im so thankful that the lactation nurse knew about this product
3: i got all exited seeing more reviews that it works  my daughter is 3 half month and suddenly i start having less milk  so i ordered fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules  i was taking 3 fenugreek and 2 blessed thistle with meals for a week and i didnt see really any change one lady suggested me something else that helped her  walnuts  i know from back in the days mom said that thats what doctors used to tell nursing moms  to eat walnuts for more and fatty milk  so i got a biggest bag they had in walmart and ate it i at probably good 6 oz of nuts at the end of the day i had more milk then my daughter needed and that night  i am on my second day and so far i had enough milk and some extra  i eat about 2 hand fools of walnuts a day  my husband said it takes time for herbs to get into my system and seeing that its helping more moms i will finish up the bottles and see if it will give me more milk  i will get back on how it worked  so moms try walnuts no other nuts but walnuts and see if that would help you if fenugreek and blessed thistle didnt work for you gods blessing
1: after reading reviews on this product i was really excited to get it and start taking it i imagined all the milk i would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come  unfortunately for me the only thing that came true from the reviews i read was that i started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly but i stuck with it started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production while im sure it works for some if youre just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with i dont think taking this will increase your supply much if at all but if you think youd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you
5: if it says clinically not proven i would not buy it but a friend recommended this for breast feedingbr it really is great  i dont think i would be able to breastfeed my baby without thisif i miss couple of days i dont have any milk to nurse
4: the product works well with blessed thistle  the only thing i didnt like was the maple syrup smell that your pores give off while taking this  my husband can smell when im around
5: towards the end of breastfeeding my son i began taking fenugreek and blessed thistle it really brought my milk supply back the only issue was that i smelled like maple syrup i didnt really have an issue  it was just strange
5: i knew about fenugreek but my lactation consultant suggested that i take this in conjunction with blessed thistle dont confuse with milk thistle  it helped my supply increase some but not lots  i took 3 fenugreek and 3 blessed thistle three times a day  consult your lactation consultant about dosing size but this worked for me  apparently the fenugreek works best when paired with blessed thistlebr br a hrefhttp
4: i had not had a problem making enough milk for my little guy but a few weeks after i went back to work i noticed i was having trouble pumping enough milk for him for the next day not to mention to store in case of an emergencybr i was told to take 2 of these pills 3 times day  first day i took it i only took 2 pills because i wanted to see if a smaller daily intake would suffice  well im glad i only took one dose because the next morning i woke up engorged  had i taken more i think my boobs would have blown up i take 2 pills once a day and every morning my bra is soaked with milkbr now im not so nervous about making enough milk for him and now maybe i dont have to lug that heavy pump back and forth from and to work  hopefully ill be able to make enough in two pumps and i can leave it at workbr a couple of reasons for the 4 stars and not 5  i do smell a hint of that curry smell not great but not overwhelming and also my baby has been having issues with gas and has kept me up for a couple of nights  im not sure though if fenugreek has anything to do with it  ill update when i figure it out
5: my daughter was lbw and didnt latch at all and ive somehow been able to exclusively pump for 3 months and started to dry slowly the fenugreek capsules worked marvels i took 2 capsules thrice a day and my supply has gone upi saw some reviews about the taste of milk being syruppybut nothing like that for me it doesnt alter taste that much and my lil one is feeding just fine and i am so happy i am able to meet her demands even when exclusively pumpingthanks to fenugreek
4: my babys doctors recommended this to increase milk supply 610mg 3 times a day i was skeptical but not anymore i overproduce for my preemie daughter now and love it
1: this brand did not help me with my milk supply  i bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site and found this to be inferior  the capsules smell like medicine not maple syrup and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills 3 x a day i never got the maple syrup sweat like i did with the other brand  i will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality
3: im halfway through the bottle but im not too sure if it worked or not but i got heavier boobs
5: when my daughter was only a week old my milk supply went downhill fast i also had lopsided breasts bc i avoided my right breast every once in awhile bc the nipple hurt after talking to my doctor she told me it was safe to try fenugreek 3 pills 3 times a day blessed thislte aka milk thistle 1 pill 3 times a day and mothers milk tea 35 cups a day  which i couldnt drink bc it was gross about a week later my right breast caught up and i was pumping 3 oz per breast as to the 1 oz i was getting my right breast was only droplets before i am confident that my daughter is now getting full with each feeding only bad thing is the fenugreek gives my skin a weird smell but it is worth it
3: increased milk volume but caused extreme gaspain in the baby so after 3 days stopped using it entirely mothers milk tea  worked but triggered colic will give some formula if not able to produce enough
5: im 19 and was taking this for my skin and was hoping for breast growth  saw very little results  but this herb keeps my sugar cravings under control my cravings get terrible to where i get irratible and cant get sweets out of my head with this stuff i was able to lose a bit of weight from a decreased appetite you will be surprised how often cravings trick you into thinking you want food anyway also in conjunction with other herbs ive noticed more curves and a bigger butt boobs are semi larger but im losing hope with those i will honestly take fenugreek for the rest of my life take that chocolate bar
5: i had been reading a lot about what would increase milk production  taking two of these capsules 3 times a day really made a difference the product arrive quickly and did the trick  i would recommended it
1: before i ordered this product i read the review and decided to give it a try i dont know about the others but personally it was not effective for me  i exclusively breastfed my baby for 6 months and i was producing at least 5 4ozbottle a day and after 6 months i dont know what happened but i produce less and less so i tried this product used this product for 2 weeks and drank a lot of liquids but still i have not produced as much as i was expecting i will produce i only produced 2 bottles a day so now i stopped using it i dont know if i did not use it right or it is not really effective
5: fenugreek seed helps with digestion if you are not a new mother and breastfeeding  from what i observed my digestion became more evenly spaced over time and i was hungry for food later than without taking the fenugreek  i did not take the supplement regularly however and gave it to my sister who breastfeeds  i can report her good news that the product works wonders for mothers and babies  if you are a new mother and want an abundance of milk at your babys feedings i recommend this product and brand to you
5: i wanted to write a review since i didnt see many from moms who took fenugreek while nursing an older baby as opposed to a newborn after we sleep trained my daughter and she began sleeping through the night at 8 months my milk supply started to drop way more than i wanted it to this may have also been because i was taking a bvitamin supplement which included b6 which women take to suppress lactation  i know i was kicking myself once i found this out i started taking 3 capsules of fenugreek and 2 capsules of blessed thistle 3x a day at meals and increased my daytime feedings to my relief within 2 days my milk supply definitely increased i highly recommend it
1: i has been 2 days since i started taking fenugeek day 1 i took 2 pills x 3 but i didnt see any effect day 2 i increased 3 pills x 3 i didnt think my milk supply was increasing but it made my son so gassy he became so fussy and cried all day because he wasnt able to release gas i felt so bad that i couldnt do anything to help himbr br i dont want to see my son suffer anymore so i will stop taking this
3: before returning to work from maternity leave at 7 weeks id already started exclusively pumping getting about 8oz per session reading all the documentation about it i was probably overproducing the first week back at work was fine no decrease second week each day i was getting 12oz less a session third week it dipped down even lower losing 34ozsession so total each session i was getting 253 oz baby needs 4 i started using fenugreek and maybe noticed an increase of about 51oz per session taking 2 pills 3x a day 4th week i took 3 pills 3x a dayand this gave me an extra 1ozsession i was producing just enough barely to keep up with baby and not enough to freeze anybr br i increased pumping sessions to every 3 hours like clockwork even throughout the night this seemed to help luckily baby sleeps 67 hours now at night so i could pump an extra bottle out during that time to make up for what i was lacking throughout the daybr br side note
4: i started taking these 3 pills 3 times a day with plenty of water and pumping and was able to stash at least 10oz or more in the freezer everyday  im a working mom so i pump before i leave for work and then 34 times during my 9hr work day and feed on demand when im home with my daughter  i was also drinking milkmaid tea twice a day  im sure if it was the combination of the two but i was very happy with the results  my freezer is overflowing with milk and i have plenty in the fridge for daycare everyday  i never had a problem with any of the side effects other complained of but i did have a break in use for about two weeks or so  i was still able to produce enough with out it but i liked the idea of stashing plenty for rainy days  im not a fan of the maple syrup smell in my sweat  urine though
4: i purchased this for my sister while sitting in the nicu with her and her newborn twins she had been pumping trying to get her milk to come in so it could be provided for her 32 weekers
5: fenugreek was recommended by our lactation nurse and it has helped tremendously to increasing the amount of milk produced  the only downside is that it leaves you feeling a little gassy
4: i have to say that i was skeptical at first to try but the pediatrician gave me the go ahead to take it  my baby was highly allergic to baby formula plus she was a tiny baby  i had to find something to increase my milk supply to help increase her birth weigh quickly  i read every amazon review and i want to write one to also help another mom  you may or the baby may get gassy but no painsevery baby is different  this fenugreek capsules works it definitely increases your milk supply if you are an organic fanatic they sell it too but both capsules look identical  good luck to all the nursing moms
4: i have had a low breastmilk supply from the very beginning and have tried just about everything to increase it  at the recommendation of a lactation consultant i started taking 4 capsules 3 times a day  within 48 hours i saw an ounce increase with each pump which was huge for me  it has continued to improve and i have been taking fenugreek for about 5 weeksbr br the downsides
5: it works on me after taking this supply one day6 capsules per day my breast milk increases 1oz per pump its good enough for my 2month old baby  no more formula is needed  thanks god for this magical herb
5: i would have to say that yes it works however be aware that you might bleed more while on your cycle
5: i used this along with blessed thistle and brewers yeast when my milk supply started to go down from exercising and going back to work  my supply went back up to normal within 24 hrs  i take 3 tabs each with each meal  it makes your urine and sweat smell like maple syrup but thats a small price to pay for providing ample nourishment for your babybr br it also helped that i drink enough fluids and pump until my breasts are empty after feedings
2: i bought these with the hopes that it would increase my milk production  while it did increase my production just a little bit it left my breast milk with a strange odor  i also noticed that the baby began to become very fussy after feedings so maybe a slight reaction to the herb so i discontinued
1: this product got fantastic reviews so i bought it  with my first baby i made tons of milk but my second one i cant seem to get more than 2oz each side  i tried pumping longer and at a higher speed  nothing  i tried this out for 2 weeks  i took 2 capsules in the morning 2 capsules in the afternoon and 2 before i went to bed  no difference at all none  i was soooo disappointed
5: i bougth this to use while nursing my newborn  i started taking it when she was 2 days old  nursing has been great she gets plenty of milk  i have no concerns about running out of milk  this is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest i dont know for sure if its because of the fenugreek but all i can say is that my baby is super happy  so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk  also i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general and can help prevent breast cancer which runs in my family  so i will definatly continue taking it even after im done nursing  plus i gave 5 stars bc amazon has the best price for this  i checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online
4: fenugreek worked for me after my milk supply started to diminish after going back to work i tried fenugreek i had to take quite a bit of it though for my milk to sustain my boys hardy appetite i never had an overabundance of milk but i was at least able to get what he needed the only side effect i had was my sweat smelled of maple syrup my son also smelled like it when i went outside i actually attracted bees it became quite the joke between my friends and myself it was worth it though to be able to continue feeding him on my ownbr my poor second son was allergic to my milk so i wasnt able to see if it worked ill be trying it again with my 3rd son due in a couple months if i cant keep up with him bees or no bees
5: it works but dont over do it i reacted very quickly and strongly to this supplement causing an oversupply of milk if that happens to you pump off some of the foremilk before breastfeeding and take less pills per day read the instructions carefully it does work
5: fenugreek works for me i recommend it for anyone looking to increase their breast milk production i will continue to use it as long as im breastfeeding i could definitely see a difference in my breast milk production within the first 2 weeks
5: i have had milk supply issues since the day my baby was born in part due to pcos and hypothyroidism  after both my lactation consultant and my babys pediatrician recommended fenugreek i finally tried it  i have worked my way up to 4 capsules 4 times a day plus blessed thistle goats rue alfalfa and domperidone  only after several weeks of this combination have i finally been able to stop supplementing with formula  i dont know which products are doing the trick or if they truly are each contributing but i wouldnt stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply  for the record though i started fenugreek first and noticed an increase though it wasnt until i had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient  i highly recommend fenugreek and after trying several brands i feel natures way is superior to some others out there
5: i was told to use this product because i didnt have enough milk for the cluster feeding time at night  i took 1012 a day and it totally helped  the mothers milk tea that you can buy does have fenugreek but not enough to make a difference i totally recommend using this product
2: this brand of fenugreek does not work  if i could send back the open bottle i would have  i will stick with the gnc brand because natures way made my milk supply go down drastically  after taking the gnc brand my milk supply went up
1: i tried taking for a few weeks 3 caps 3 xs per day as recommended to aide in nursing i saw absolutely no difference in the amount of milk i was pumping or producing  the way it makes you smell is horrible too  i swear the stuff just comes out of your pores and smells like maple syrup  it also made me extremely gassy and made my baby gassy as well i wouldnt purchase again
5: i have been using fenugreek as a galactagogue for over almost two years now and it works incredibly well  this is an excellent price for the product and i have had great success working with the company  i will continue to order from them as long as my son is nursing
2: made me smell like curry and retain water all over bodybr did the job though not crazy about the side effects lol
3: now i have to give this product a 3 because yes it works but there were some complications i did not notice a difference right away like some mothers it was about 3 days after taking 3 capsules 3x a day that i had an increase in my supply i was able to pump about 2 oz after each feeding prior  to taking the fenugreek then it increased to about 6 oz after each feeding i was storing for returning to work about the time i started getting a result my son was getting the side effects of horrible tummy pains it made him constipated to where he didnt have a bm for 7 days and he stayed up for almost 20 hrs straight screaming at one point he was about 2 months old and a very happy baby normally for this reason i had to discontinue use i would recomend it for mothers who are having issues with their milk supply because this is not the case for all babies and the product works but i would recomend discontinuing use at the first sign of a gassy fussy baby because it takes several days to get baby comfortable again once it starts i got no sleep for 4 days in a row yuck
3: this product is great as you will see an increase in your milk supply probably btw 13 days after taking these pills but what i did notice 34wks into taking it that all of a sudden i was eating like i was pregnant increased appetite and needless to say looking very swollen and gaining extra weight  it wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done i decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden i was noticeably gaining weight
5: i bought this product after it was recommended by a friend who was referred to it by a lactation consultant  like my friend im a breastfeeding mom who went back to work and since then my supply had dropped  my friend said that after five days of taking fenugreek she noticed a significant increase in her supply  when i started taking it my supply increased within two days  i pump at work and i easily get five ounces from each session now that i take fenugreek  i take three of them three times a day with each meal  i am so relieved to have this product because it is very important to me to continue breastfeeding my baby  if i could give it 10 stars i would
5: i feel my milk supply increased within 24 hours i have loose bowel movement on the first day of taking fenugreek seed pills but it help my constipation  i was nursing my daughter almost by the hour in the first month and its necessary to establish milk supply with help of this pill now i can breastfeed my 2monthold without supplement no more bottle washing save time save money lose weight without diet and exercise its been great
5: it is the same that i have bought in the past at health food stores and at a more reasonable price
1: use with caution when my baby was 5 weeks old i noticed that my milk supply was decreasing i was taking 2 pills 3 times a day for about a week when i started felling really sick i head strong headaches i was weak and i had problem with breathing my baby had a cough and was spitting up milk she could not swallow the mucus in her mouth was very thick i learned from my doctor that fenugreek has very dangerous side effects
2: this was my last attempt to try and increase my milk supplyit didnt work for me after using for 3 weeks it also made my little one gassy so it was not worth it to try it longer given the gas issues
5: works great i take fenugreek and blessed thisle together each 3 tablets 3xday my milk supply more than doubled win 48hrs
5: i got this stuff because i read it is good for pms ive noticed that it helps with mood swings during all times of the month  my skin cleared up and has never been more clear  im a lot more mellow and not stressed out  i might keep taking this stuff all the time
4: i started taking this to increase my milk supply after i went back to work i pump every three hours while at work and i just wasnt making as much milk these pills work great no bad aftertaste or anything
5: fenugreek has many different purposes and uses the one that we take it for is either runny noses or stuffed up noses when we start to get colds this really works great we will normally take astragalus along with fenugreek when we start to notice we are either stuffed up or have a runny nose the two seem to work great together the way that we use it isnt an every day vitamin its more of a when you are sick vitamin depending on how bad it is we will either take it once a day or once in the morning and once in the eveningbr br hope this helped you out
5: the items that i ordered came on time the product is great and it worked just like the reviews stated i will definitely use these pills again when we have another child
5: i got these to help increase my milk supply and in combination with other milk enhancing products this seemed to work well though lactation cookies are more delicious and perhaps equally as effective these are cheaper and less fattening
3: while i think the product itself is just fine i was really disappointed that the seller wouldnt ship to an fpo address i had to rereoute the product just to get it here i use fenugreek to increase breastmilk supply though the label does not indicate that use for it i should also mention that the pills smell like maple syrup and after taking them i found i did too
4: i bought these for my wife whose had a tough time with breastfeeding she had a csection so it was about 45 hours before the hospital let our daughter nurse for the first time unfortunately my wife went home without getting things figured out and things got even tougher the lactation nurse helped on an outpatient basis and strongly suggested fenugreek i purchased this right away and it was taken with each meal finally my daughter had that wellfedcanbarelykeepmyeyesopen look on her face after nursing fenugreek taken 3 times a day has been the best advice weve received so far for breastfeeding even if your infant isnt crying feed himher at least every three hours maybe more if you can do it also my daughter was an excellent sleeper and her pediatrician said to wake her up and encourage her to nurse these suggestions along with the fenugreek increased my wifes milk supply and made for a happy healthy and chubby baby
4: i take this now to increase milk supply and i think it is working i pump 5 oz each breast a time every three hours at work i am not sure exactly how much my 3 months old drinks when i nurse him directly but he seems to be happy with flowing milk  this product is one of many things i try to increase the milk supply so i dont know if only this herb helped it but i believe it did by seeing much difference in pump mount anyway ill keep taking it since it is easy to take in capsules
5: this is working wonders for me i pump only three times a day and i have built up a frozen and refrigerated storage of breast milk i cant imagine life without this definitely a must buy if your supply is low
5: i am into 4 weeks postpartum and exclusive pumper i started on these capsules 2 weeks before and definitely noticed the difference i am pretty sure pumping frequently plus fenugreek made the difference i am now pumping 50 oz per day as compared to 30oz prior highly recommend it 
5: good nutritional value and easy to prepare  i reinvented use for my old rice cooker and hot breakfast is ready by the time i get out of the shower in the morning
5: i just bought this product at the supermarket where i paid a pretty penny for it when comparing it to a box of any kind of cereal the number of servings per box has to be considered along with things like protein content because i have paid a dollar each for certain cereal snacksports bars i was willing to give this a try and i am glad i did with half a handful of craisins a touch of honey it was bliss vs neigh mr ed how are your plain oats this morning
5: using my whirly popjust heat up the oil add 2
3: its pretty good and easy to use and it will last for a long time i have a nostalgic popcorn maker and it seems to burn the caramel a little bit but im sure with practice it will be perfect
4: good chocolate flavor with a slightly bitter taste not as rich as decadent chocolate or chocolate mudslide
1: i opened the first of four bags and it did not smell at all like chocolate or even like coffee  it had a slightly odd odor not good in fact kind of like old leaves but i thought that just perhaps a pot brewed from this might be okay  it was if anything worse it tasted simply awful like it was spoiled somehow  now theres no expiration or production date on the packages that i could find only a copyright date of 2009  i dont know whether this is the way it normally tastes i cant really imagine that or if it was a bad batch or had simply spoiled somehow but i think it was likely one of the two latter options  i am not keen however on paying money to try this again  amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase pricebr br im a regular coffee drinker 4 cupsday and have brewed two pots a day for going on 25 years for the family  im a big fan of chocolate coffees and other flavored coffees and ive not experienced any coffee remotely like what was in this package
3: i use treats for obedience and agility classes  i need a treat that is not crunchy but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits  this product is easily broken uptoo easily  it reminds me of a thin layer of chocolate but does not melt as such the selling point is the natural dehydration rather than freeze dried  i did not find it useful for my purpose
2: i want the absolute best for my dog but this is really really expensive almost 8 dollars for just about 3 pieces of dehydrated meat
5: if you are looking for a healthy treat for your dog look no further  these dehydrated treats apparently taste great because my finicky dog loves them  its difficult to find treats that are made in the usa  these are and they are worth the price knowing youre not feeding your best friend some crap from china
2: i should have looked at the weight and dimensions on this before ordering my fault  the package is tinybr br the product seems fine but the cost is extremely highbr br there are other very good all natural products out there at a much lower cost
5: i did not expect dry roasted unsalted cashews to taste this good  it was a great suprise  i will order them again
5: excellent having just returned from italy this is the exact one we purchased there that is widely used it is especially good on a caprese salad tomatoesfresh basil and fresh mozzerella
5: love this oatmeal organic is good it is only 147 per box at heb in texas you would only pay 441 for three boxes instead of the ridiculous price of 18something
2: the advertisiment shows keebler sugar free cookies and all i got was murray which i dont like  so now i have 120 packages that im giving away lokk at the packages on the picture they have the kebbler emblem mine didnt
4: these are some of the best cookies that i have ever eaten  you would never know that they was sugar free  my only problem that i had was that my box had been opened and retaped and was short 8 packs  but other then that i highly recommend these if you like lemon cookies  jeff
4: i bought these cookies for my diabetic mom and she just loves them  they were murray brand and did not look like the package shown
1: i thought i was purchasing keebler cookies but i received a box of murray cookies i just tried one pack of the murray cookies didnt like it at all i will never order these cookies again i recommend that you buy oreo sugar free cookies if you are craving a chocolate sandwich they are so good dont buy them online since its about 65 more expensive than your local grocery store
5: these cookies arrived quickly and are in great shape  they are very fresh and are all shortbread  the brand sent is murray and looks just like the picture  ignore the kebbler title  the shortbread is made with splenda and has a pleasant vanillalike aftertaste  eight little cookies come in a packet  each is 112 in diameter  the packet is 130 calories and has 140 mg of sodium the packet says its equivalent to one diabetic exchange each of fat and carbohydrate  i feel that one packet is just the right size for a midmorning or midafternoon snack  highly recommend
5: i first tasted the keebler shortbread sugar free cookies at a hospital cafeteria  i had never seen this sugar free brand on a grocery shelf so i started searching the www  i was grateful to find them available through amazon but somewhat surprised that upon receipt of my order the label is murrays instead of keebler ive seen murrays in my grocery but the label is not appealing like keeblers label  taste is the same  thanks
1: this is suppose to be a variety pack it contains 60 packs of shortbread cookies 30 packs of lemon and 30 packs of chocolate chip cookies  not much of a variety as far as im concerned
5: i have used altoids for a long time but this was the first time i purchased the flavor simply mintthey have a light mint taste that is very good plus they are sugar freei also purchased the wintergreen and cinnamon which are sugar freei enjoy all of these flavors and im glad they are sugar free so they wont damage your teethim also diabetic so i dont have to worry about them raising my blood glucose levelthey were packaged very well and i received them promptlythank you for such good service and a great producti will definitely order these again from amazoncom
5: i have never tried altoids before so i have purchased this tried it for the first time and i really like it
4: need more flavors in the small mints spearmint etc love the small mints better than the bigger ones and less conspicuous at work
4: i bought these because my wife loves them and asked for some for christmas  i could not find them locally so ordered off amazon and was a little nervous since i was going out of town before christmas and was worried they would not get here beforehand  they did arrive quickly and well packaged  worked out great as a stocking stuffer
5: i was in a grocery store which must have been on mars and purchased a tin of altoid smalls simply mint  it is truly addicting so i bought another on mars  now i cannot find them anywhere or find my way back to mars  i was ecstatic when they popped up on amazon
5: i love these mints because they are not as strong as the regular altoids  they seem to be difficult to find in stores so it was great the amazon had them for bulk purchase
5: soi walk into a candy shop somewhere in gotham meaning for me somewhere between between brooklyn and manhattan wanting a tin of mints to cleanse my palate when i come across a small tin of altoids simply mint taken by the novelty and wondering what the simply part was about i bought a tinand regretted buying w fistful more of those tins strong enough to take the edge off a fairlypungent meal yet just mild enough to be truly enjoyable on their own borderline addictive id say simply mint is not merely my favorite altoids mints but my favorite mints period as the previous reviewer mentioned its awfully good to be able to get them via amazon since the things are pretty thin on the ground in nyc
5: these noodles are great for soft you just boil them in chicken stock  like it says on the package takes about 5 minutes put noodles in a bowl with just a little stock then add green onions bacon pieces and hard boiled eggs sliced up with a little soy sauce and it is wonderful people just dont know about these noodles my dad was in veitnam and when he came home he did all the cooking and i have been eating them for 35 years the best thing about these noodles is you can fry them up in a wok or pan with regular oil and they are the bomb they are so good when you get done boiling them just drain and rinse really well with cold water to get the starch out and let them dry out as much as possible them fry them up and drain on a paper towel
5: my husband loves these noodles  his mother used to make them for him and i was so happy to find a brand as good as the ones his mom used to buy  he just eats them boiled with soy sauce and loves them  we could not find these noodles in the super market so i was delighted to find them here
1: i would give this no stars but not sure how toi bought these at a local store thank goodness i can return them my family loves potato salad and mashed potatoes so i thought i would give them a shot took me twice as long as it would have if i had just peeled the potatoes as i usually do you have to cook the potatoes before you peel them  but only halfway and if they are not cooked anough the peel doesnt come off as easy as they say then you put them back in the water to finish boiling the bumps on the gloves that give  them the rough texture also started to come off with the second potatobr br dont waste your money  just keep a very sharp knife handy
1: tater mitts   a miserable productbr cumbersome uncomfortable no potato left by the end of the peeling  then adding insult to injury you have to cleanup the gloves  the sink after making the mess  the only positive point is that our family gets a good laugh every christmas by mentioning that a certain family member passedup giving us tater mitts this year  everyone is glad that they found something else to give everyone this year 
5: absolutely the best not too salty has nice hot spice and chili flavors too sometimes a salsa will be too thin or have some overbearing taste to it like cilantroor just be so hot that all you taste is the heat this is not too thick not too thin and has a nice flavor along with the very hot habanero flavor i can use this for dipping cooking seasoning or for tacos if i cant find this in a local store i used to order this direct from the manufacturers delighted to see it here on amazon now i can get this item so conveniently
4: this mccormick sea salt is delicious so much better than regular table salt  it has a coarse texture and fine flavor  to help grind up the crystals the salt bottle comes with its own grinder up top  just turn it over and twist  the only downside is sometimes guests dont know how to do that
5: my fav local coffee shop was using this product now theyve lost a customer because i can have it at home  great frappe for those who like blended drinks but dont want anything either too bitter or too sweet however you can always adjust the flavor level and experiment with the amount of ice to produce your perfect choice  if you use soy milk be warned it does alter the flavor substantially
5: great snack if youre thinking of buying these go ahead and do it you can thank me later it is a sweet bread stick covered in chocolate the thing is it tastes like a dark chocolate rather than a milk chocolate so the flavor is intense and quite awesome at that i bought ten boxes and i only have a few left thats how good these are
5: fell in love with these when i lived in korea they had thier own version but i found the pocky brand on a wekend trip to japan they  were  far superior to the local brand in korea they even have them at my local safeway here in nevada but cheaper to buy in 10 packs thru amazon these are a fun and awesome snacki can reccomend them
3: quality of the product was sufficient given that its packaged pretzels and chocolate if you dont know what youre getting into its pretty much that
5: if pocky isnt the very best thing ever then it should certainly be way way up on the listbr i can never have enough of these  pocky is a perfect balance of biscuit sort of a pretzel stick though im usually not fond of pretzel crackers and chocolate its very good chocolate and is excellent with the biscuit i dont know anyone who doesnt likelove these
5: gocce di sole is a sugar coated jelly candy that comes in five citrus flavors orange lemon lime pink grapefruit and mandarin orange  the candy is soft and fresh with a true fruit flavor the jellies are coated in crystals of sugar that tastes like sugar and not gummy glop  this product bears no resemblance to dried out supermarket candy that is stale and difficult to chew  this candy tastes like actual fruit and arrives soft and fresh  three pieces 35 grams have 0 grams of fat and only 100 calories  so its about as guilt free as a treat can be
5: if youre used to those bestselling boxed raisins that feature a health woman happily working in the fields get real and then get newmans organic raisinsbr br these may be the besttasting grocery raisins youve ever had nothing even approaches these for their flavor texture and all those newman company extras that aficionados like me adore were talking organic ingredients environmentally sound production profits donated to the needy and supporting the goals of one of the most compelling actors of all time and a heck of a nice guy as wellbr br but back to the food at handbr br these are plump juicy raisins startlingly different from the usual fare i dont know how they do it but newmans organic california raisns retain their natural flavor pleasant scent and a succulent mouth feel that one expects from fine port  one secret may be the ingredients
5: we buy lots of raisins  none compare to these  they are plump soft  sweet  no yucky hard  bitter raisins here  what makes them perfect is they are organic and delicious  you will love them  your body  the environment will thank you
5: i love organic raisins and eat them every day i have tried many different brands of them and i honestly think that these are the very best of them all i love the container and the ease of opening and closing it also the raisins are always fresh and delicious they are never dried out like other brands sometimes are i am addicted to these
3: these taste good and are a good substitute for your standard box of raisins to avoid all the toxins of commercial farmingbr i have had better though larger plumper raisins from the healthfood storebr br get them for your health not for anything unique
5: these are the best organic raisins i have tried to datebr they are sealed fresh soft and moist with a burst of flavoreachbr and every can when i divide the cost out on what i was buying beforebr ie store brand organicsthere is no comparisionbr newmans own is far superior in costtasteand i can recyle the packagingbr in my recycle program on the curb
5: we originally bought these because of a promotion but because they are the best raisins out there we recently took our sixth shipment from amazon the 6 pack of canisters is good for a family of four for about 34 months the 15 discount for subscribe and save helps out and you can cancel if you dont want to receive anymore without penalty
4: the price is not great but its fair its paul newman so thats a plus theyre organic but im still not sure why thats important i like raisins i eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies even with oatmeal sometimes these almost seem like a different fruit than the other raisins that i have had  they are softer and a much richer flavor  after all  a raisin is a dried grape these are good raisins and they taste much better than grocery store raisins actually i was a little shocked at how good they were id read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite what i got was a great raisin
5: i used these raisins primarily for bakinglta cooking tip in case they are dry just soak them before you use them in your recipiesthey were sweetmoist and i would purchase them again
3: usually these are great but this batch isnt quite as good  they are a little dry and dont seem as fresh  i will order them again though because they are usually great  normally i would give this brand 5 stars but this shipment only gets 3
5: the other reviews have it spot on these are really good especially when you first unseal them
5: i trust newmans organic products to actually be organic good product at a great price i keep bulk amounts in the house to make crockpot steel cut oatmeal a good way to get a daily serving of fruit and sweetens the oats without needing additional sugar
5: if you are in the market for organic raisins newmans own is a great brand the taste is delicious the freshness excellent and the company has an outstanding reputation for healthy products produced under earthfriendly conditions a further advantage amazon offers is the chance to buy this product through subscribe and save
5: much fresher than the usual sun maid i buy at store less sugar too so they taste at a much higher quality i will continue to buy these in bulk to save  hopefully the seller is reading my interview and sends me a code for discount since i gave a generous review
5: i was on the fence because of having to buy 6 containers at once days later when i tasted the first bite i was thanking myself for buying them they are sweet and better than expectedbr br i have not tried other organic raisin brands and i lucked out i will buy this brand every time i need raisins and i will try this brands cranberries and prunes too i wish they offered more types like cherries and blueberries and figs and apricots
5: since grapes are on the list of things you should buy organic i figured it was a safe bet that raisins would be included  local stores dont seem to carry these so i was pleased to find them on amazon  i was very pleased with the quality of these raisins  fresh sweet no hard dried up ones  no noticeable taste difference from the grocery store ones so my family liked them and i feel better about giving them organic
5: a great addition to any dish or just right out of the box  do note that these need to be refrigerated once the package is opened
5: this product is fresh taste greatand the raisins are so plump and juicyoh and the price is pretty good also
5: we love these raisins  the quality is excellent and they provide a healthy snack  i would recommend having these on hand for snacking or for use in recipes
4: the first time i got these raisins from amazon they were great  plump sweet and smooth the way raisins should be  the second time however the raisins were like old or poorly stored raisins  more grainy and not nearly as moist  so i give the first batch five stars and the second batch two or three stars  who knows what you will get  you pays your money and you takes your chances
5: after purchasing my first box of newmans own raisins i was convinced never to buy any other brandthese are superior
5: i ordered these for my mother because she was unable to find a container size like this  she told me that the raisins tasted very good and enjoys them in cereal  the subscribeandsave program made them an even better value
5: this are the best raisins  they are plump and favorful  i keep the extras in my big freezer and just thaw them out as we need them  cant say anything negative
5: these are very healthy organic raisins certified by oregons agency tasty moistness is fine for methis is a matter of preferenceother raisins have vegetable oil added to make them moistthankfully these do notbr and you get to support charities when you purchase themmuch better than buying unhealthy candy barsbr whats not to like 
5: love these raisins  they are delicious and plump great price for organic too instructions say to refrigerate after opening can but i find that makes them shriveled and hard
5: the container is a good size to keep the raisins fresh  the raisins taste goodbr br this is exactly what i expect from organic raisins  i eat this every morning in oatmeal and it makes me happy
4: good raisins and they are organic which is what i was looking for they are pretty plump and taste like raisins
5: we are going organic  these were the right price for the right amount of  now if they could only cut down on the packaging
5: these receive a goldilocks review
5: i love organic foods and these raisins are a great way to start off my morning in my breakfast cereal  timely delivery and great service
5: our local supermarket chain was recently bought by another large grocery chain and so far they are not carrying newmans own organic raisins i didnt think it mattered until i started buying other raisins organic and nonorganic and discovered a myriad of flavors in the raisin world i did not know there could be so many different tastes from raisins and none of them anywhere close to the delicious flavor of the newmans own since taste is very personal i am sure each reader of this review has their own opinion and raisin favorite i applaud whatever raisin is your choice to love this is my choice and it has to do with juiciness and a subtle sugar flavor and many raisins in each can and definitely that this company shares its profits with charities i am very happy that i can buy them on amazon with a subscription and i dont need to care if my local grocery stocks it
4: husband eats raisins by the handful  these are very good and the most reasonably priced organic raisins ive found
5: i never cared for raisins before trying newmans own  now i try to give everyone a bite because they are so much better than the other brands  these raisins are nice and plump and almost buttery  they are perfect
5: these raisins are moist and have a lot of flavor  just need to remember to refrigerate after opening since there are no preservatives
5: even my family who believe most organic products are a waste of money are big fans of these raisins  they are plump moist and really satisfy my sweet tooth  i cannot find them locally in my small town so im glad to buy them on amazon
5: i have been buying paul newmans coffee for over a year and absolutely loved i ordered this box to try and i was pleasantly surprised about the freshness and the taste of these raisins i am using it in my cereal and i think that i am already addicted to them
5: these raisins taste very good theres a lot of raisins to last a long time too with all of the subscribe and save items we have my home is starting to look like a warehouse but i dont mind having these healthy nutritious foods around for my family
5: this is my fourth order of newmans own organic raisins and theyre consistently the best ever after trying organic raisins at a few health food stores including trader joes these are not only better but for the same price as tj theyre delivered right to my door i love it d
4: shipped on time and fresh  i eat them  sometimes a lot of them in one big handful you know when you grab a bunch and a few fall to the floor  sometimes i get mad about those that i lose to gravity  good raisins though
5: great price on this fabulous product from newmans own i cant get them locally for this much thanks amazon
5: this is the second time weve ordered newmans own organic raisins and we have been quite pleased  the raisins are plump tasty and just the right textureas juicy as a raisin can be  we received them in a timely manner and are quite happy with the product  we will be ordering again and would definitely recommend it to others
5: great taste very juicy few if any stems i usually get the pavich jumbos but my last batch was a little too dried out
3: i like raisins  i eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies  even with ham sometimes  but it seems a raisin is a raisin is a raisin  no matter who packages them  after all  a raisin is a dried grape  these are good raisins but they taste no better than grocery store raisins  actually i was a little disappointed  id read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite  what i got was a good raisin  right now i am eating some while i reread some of the glowing reviews and listen to peggy lee singing is that all there isbr br the price is not great but its not bad either  its paul newman so thats a good thing  theyre organic but im still not sure why thats importantbr br average
3: these are tiny sweet raisins that you would bite into an occasional tiny stems when you eat  they are not as plump as the fanny raisins  its not bad and not that great in my opinion
4: im not going to write 4 paragraph review for this item because its just raisinsbr br part 1 for people who care about organic food
2: tastes the same to me regardless of whatever chemicals is in it or not i rather pay less for your standard sun maid
3: thought i would be nice and send flowers to my motherinlaw amazon had the most beautiful bouquet gorgeous and good price the downer was it did not arrive until 2 days after mothers day and there was no place for me to write a card note etc fortunately mother called and we straightened it out with her she was pleased i would have loved it if they delivered on time and of course i should have been able to include a card as i was filling out all the processing info i kept waiting to see where i include a note but poof the order was processed but no entrya hrefhttp
5: made it in time for mothers day on a very short notice mom got them today and loves them would definitely recommend
5: i learned to drink the lighter beers with salt and a lime wedge in mexico where i live finding the small round mexican limes is difficult and even if you have them on hand youve still got to cut a wedge out and the rest is wasted if youre just having one enter twang it gives the beer the right flavor with a couple of shakes and its easy to carry along
5: the lemonlime version which is to my taste a tad more tart is available locally for me so i purchased the lime flavor from amazon to do double duty
5: i have bought their lemon and apricot flavors they are so good i cannot imagine the other flavors could be better but i may have to try them one day my son has a sugar intolerence so weve used sweet leaf stevia for years we added 5 or 6 drops of the apricot to a large glass of water and he asks for apricot water instead of soda pop sent some to relatives and they love it toobr br highly recommend all sweet leaf products
5: its a refreshing treat to add flavored stevia to water when you have blood sugar problems its so much better for you than fruit juice orbr soda  try it amazon had a good price too
5: my favorite of the liquid stevia flavors  i put it in plain nonfat yoghurt with a dash of cinnamon  delicious
4: my senses percieve stevia to be a bit sweeter than what the makers suggest so i use a little less than recomended the result is a pleasant and nonsyrupy concotion that i enjoy
5: ive been using stevia for more than 10 years  and i particularly love the apricot fragrance because it cuts the sweetness a little and gives drinks a little tang
5: sweatleaf liquid stevia is a must for any one who enjoys flavoring their ice tea  the apricot flavoring is a great way to make your favorite drink sweet  i started using it because it was a chemical sweetener and it was also one that does affect blood sugar  this a great product that goes a long way  the only thing you must keep in mind is to use very small amounts and work up it is much sweeter than sugar
5: i love this flavor put it in my iced tea and it is like a fruit drink  it satisfies my craving for something sweet without the calories  for added spice add a slice of orange and it really brings out the flavor
5: i buy this in the summer to help me drink all the water i need here in hot hot texas its delicious in water i fill up my big 32 ounce cup and put in a dropperful super delicious and it makes it so much easier to drink a lot my kids love it too i recommend it apricot is my favorite
2: this had an off taste for me  i could not even tolerate the smell  even with the bottle unopened i could smell it  i guess everyones taste is different  id rather have plain seltzer and water than to add this to it  i gave it 2 stars because when i added it to iced tea it was tolerable still would prefer plain stevia and a bit of fresh lemon or orange juice in the tea rather than to add this this was a waste of money for me because it went in the garbage
3: ordered two sets of  sweetleaf liquid stevia apricot nectar 2ounce bottles pack of 2br   first order came with broken bottles as the big air bags they used for padding in the shipment was deflated  told amazon and they sent out another order got it in 3 daysbr   this time the big air bag did not deflate but the bottles were all next to each other with no padding between thembr   in the future they should wrap each bottle in bubble wrap then put in box with the big air bagsbr br   i have ordered many things from amazon and this is the first problem i have ever had and they took care of it better than i expectedbr   will continue to order here
2: it does not taste bad but i thought i was purchasing something substantial not just sweet chocolate flavored water
5: i live alone and have a busy lifestyle that doesnt leave much room for time in the kitchen this product is quick easy and nutritional the 1 pound package is ideal for me and i can freeze extras for future use
5: this is an excellent product my 3 pups love them and this is the most convenient way to get them  i have signed up for automatic deliveries through amazoncom and i never have to worry about searching everywhere to get more  it comes right to my door  i will be looking for more of the things i always buy to be delivered automatically to whoever thought of this for amazoncom thank you
5: for me its great being able to buy natural treats for my dog that also taste great  my dog loves these and i like them too  ive made dog biscuits before but its convenient to be able to pick some up at the store  ive tried a number of natural biscuits some good some horrible  these are great  ive never bought them in bulk from amazon but the biscuits are inside of a sealed plastic bag within the box so id guess that they would stay fresh for a while
4: my dog white cloud was a little hesitant at first but now she really enjoys these peanut butter molasses dog treats  these are really not all that expensive and she sometimes eats 3 of them at a time  i will buy more of these
1: i have been buying blue dog bakery peanut butter and molasses dog treats for over three years my dog did love them but since the recipe changed he wont eat them any more i noticed that they didnt smell the same and that each individual biscuit was harder than rock i thought they were old stock or stale and returned them to the super market where i bought them and got my money back i tried them again from a different super market and found out the old and stale smell and feel of the dog treats was in every box i bought i returned them all again i went to the wonderful and friendly blue dog bakery website and contacted them by using their web form email for contact with the company i wanted to find out why they ruined a wonderful product the website claims that they will get right back to you regarding your comments and concerns havent heard a word from them to this day how is that for great customer service i have gone back to good old dependable milk bones and my dog is happy and im actually saving money rather than buying those stale over priced dog treats from blue dog bakery
5: i like to give my dog healthy treats  i tried a box of these low fat treets from walmart and my dog loved them  i kept going back to get more  then all of a sudden they dont have anymore on the shelves  i thought i would try to find them on the internet and was happy that i found them but not as happy as my dog  he is a black lab and has a weight problem and weighs about 127 poundsbr thank you for a fine product
5: my two dogs generally have differing opinions of treats so sometimes its hard to find a treat they both like  they love these
5: we found the blue dog snacks in a catalogue but could not find them locally  i did find amazon had the flavor phantom likes the best  i order a large quantity because my buddy receives 3 every afternoon  he greets me at the door and of course i rub him and talk to him for awhile  then i ask phantom if he would like a cookie blue dog bakery dog treats  molasses  peanut butter  he tears off into his room and sits and stares at the box until i am in the room  i pull out one large and two small cookies  he gets so excited that he is dancing all around  he knows he has to sit before he gets a snack  he will take the snack and run into the other room  there he drops the cookie and comes back for another one  this continues until he has all three cookies  when he gets all three snacks he will lay down and eat them all  his eyes light up when you ask him if he would like a cookie  blue dog makes other flavors of snacks but phantom really likes the molasses and peanut butter ones the best  i cant explain how much phantom loves his blue dog snacks
5: one of my fellow afghan hound rescue associates recommended i try these for my two boyz both of my boyz love them  from the rescue lists i am on all affies love blue dog cookiesbr i highly recommend them and will continue to buy them
5: my german shepherd nyla will sometimes even turn her nose up at a piece of ham or steak but goes crazy for the blue dog bakery peanut butter  molasses biscuits  it was such a relief to find a snack that was good for her and that she enjoyed so much  if you have a picky dog then this is a snack you will want to explore  i have shared these biscuits with everyone of my friends who have dogs and they have all come back with the same reportmy dog just loves these biscuits where did you get them  they cost a little more than regular dog biscuits but are worth every penny when you know you are giving your pet something that they love and is good for them  buying them on line at amazoncom using the subscribe and save offer has saved me quite a bit of money and is very convenient and easy to use  i highly recommend using this service  take a chance your dog will love you and you will be very satisfied with the product and service
5: i have a miniature schnauzer who is allergic to chicken  for a treat this is safe for her to eat without her having any problems  i will continue to buy them
2: my dog loves these treats and they smell so good ive tried three different stores and cant find them anywhere too bad no one from the marketing dept reads these reviews maybe they would start carrying them again im very disappointed i can no longer buy these treats
4: ive been ordering these treats for my dogs for a few years now  they really liked them the cookies were not only adorable but apparently pretty tasty recently though the last few boxes ive bought have contained nothing but broken remnants of the advertised shapes of cookies that dont even have the cute outlines on them that originally distinguished them from each other additionally the cookies look overcooked and are very hard plus  they no longer have that fresh baked smell to them i really am disappointed in the quality control from blue dog bakery for the amount of money i spend on these i expect consistency to the quality i guess i need to find another low fat treat alternative for my furry family members
4: i have been buying blue dog bakery treats for almost 10 years  quality was really great for a number of years  in the last few years i have gotten cases 6 boxes that had all most all burnt cookies  the company replaced them  the latest purchase with the new logo are now back to the ones i liked in the past  i like that they use human grade i have ate them myself ingredients  my dogs just love them  wish i could buy boxes of the small cookies hearts and squares i have small dogs and have to break the larger ones into smaller pieces
5: my dogs are just crazy about these biscuits  when i try to give them some of costcos kirkland dog biscuits they give me this sad look before they reluctantly take them  the blue doggies get a much better reaction  i have to admit that i tasted them and they really do taste good  they are however a little too hard for human consumption
5: great price and product  my dogs love this as a good job treat cant go without it  cant find this size and flavor in local stores anymore
5: also love their doggie paws stars more blu dog bakery cookies and the live well ones they discontinued recently wish they would bring them back we have 2 large dogs and big cookies are great for them the small cookies are great for training only cookie my largest dog will respond to when sidetracked by a rabbit person or when told he must go to his room he loves them so much he races to his cage when normally he would hide rather than go there
5: my dog oscar absolutely loves these cookieshe jumps straight up and down and prances around them like a catso comical the way he shows me that he appreciates these cookies they never fail to entertain me after i give them to him
5: two labradors 6 and 5 have been treated to blue dog natural dog treats since they were four months oldthe cookies still  get the same excited response from them as they did theni am careful about what i feed my pets and was initially impressed by the ingredients in the cookiesi then became impressed by the newsletters from blue dog  regarding the approach to dog treatsmy labs get these cookies as  bedtime  cookies we say come get your nightynight cookies and they bound in and take them to their beds finally i must add that getting them from amazon is greatthey arrive so regularly that my pups nor i never have had to wait
5: my dogs just love these crunchy and healthy treats  we are very particular about what we feed our girls and are happy to have found such a good product that is a great value and made locally
5: i have five dogs ranging from a 100 lab to a 12 jack russell  all i need to do is say does anyone want a cookie and all five come running  i have been using these treats for over a year and they are loved today as well as they were when i started
5: great biscuits they smell good enough to eat  doggies of all sizes love them  highly recommend  other flavors are pretty great too  try them all
5: blue dog cookies have a good taste they clean teeth are low fat so please try them for your dog
5: the  dogs  absolutely  love  these  treats  and  these  are  made in the  usabr br no  animal by products  artificial colors  preservatives  or flavors
5: these treats are around 68 a box where i live so the price on amazon is great i bought a case of six midnovember and my dog is finally on his last box he normally goes through a 10 bag of beggin strips in a week so were saving a lot on doggie treatsbr br as for the flavor my dog will eat just about any treat but he seems to be more excited about these than most hard treats he usually prefers soft ones i like that they smell good unlike some similarly priced treats which seems to reduce stinky doggie breath and ill admit it i tasted one wasnt too impressed with the flavor but theyre not for mebr br the only downside is that some of the treats are huge but they can be broken up into smaller pieces
5: benji our 5 year  old yorkie had a case of pancreatitus loose stool ie like water and vomitting off to the vet for xrays blood tests 3 injections and 5 drugs to take home 800 the vet said benji had too much fat in his food he only ate dry dog food and a table scrap once in a while so now he eats a low fat dry dog food no table food and these great low fat treats yes they are big so break them yes they are hard good for tarter control but i must mention benji only gets a portion of one biscut per day if he does his tricks like rollover sit and bang your deadit took some time to find a low fat treat that benji would eatblue dog wins
5: this is the only dog cookie we have purchased in the past 78 years  our dogs refuse to eat any other kind
4: this is a good stable treat fred enjoys the different flavors and sizes he gets one a day or two if they are the small size if i run out of his other 2 cookies these are ok by themselves but clearly not at the top of the list however if i run out of them he does miss them just not as much as the others i know it is more than numbers because he does not miss his meaties
5: these dog biscuits are such a treat for my two large dogs  they get them as a bedtime treat and look forward to them  i was so surprised to find them at amazon and immediately signed up for the autodelivery  i was hesitant about ordering biscuits through the mail because of possible damage to the biscuits  however i was amazed that the biscuits came out whole and were not damaged at least in the two boxes that i have aleady opened  dont think you could go wrong with these
1: the entire box of treats was so hard i had to hit them with a hammer to break them small enough for my 60 lb dog to eat

1: i have two dogs and one of them didnt like the treats at all  she refused to eat any of them no matter how small  my other dog who will eat anything and i mean that  loves them  so i wont purchase them anymore since i want something they both like
5: the yummy smell of these treats almost make me want to try them my dogs love them all natural and low fat you cant get better than that i buy them in bulk supplied by amazon and cannot beat amazon because of their great price and the treats arrive within a day or 2 very fast i break them into bite size pieces and buy them about every 4 months or so
5: these cookies come in different sizes if you want a small treat look for the smaller size i have a big 120 lb gsd and these are just right for him i found this flavor helped settle his upset tummy too since i changed to grain free food taste of the wild dry pacific stream we havent had the stomach issues anymore however these did help on those days where i would see him eating grass like a hungry cow
5: we received the order very quickly much faster than expected  pepper loves these cookies and they are her favorite she will do pretty much anything to get one  they are nice sized dont fall apart and are in cute shapes
4: the dog cookies are very good but sadly the box with the 4 boxes arrived damaged i box was totally crushed other than that they are greatthey made very good chirstmas gifts for many dog friends
5: my four dogs love love love these peanut butter and molasses cookies each dog gets one before bedright after the final walk of the day sometimes a cookie or piece of cookie is awarded for a special behavior
5: goliath delilah and daisy all give this product a thundering thumbs up  this is their bedtime snack and we have no trouble getting them to go to their bedroom which they graciously allow my wife and i to share and ready themselves for the night  once when i ran out of blue dog bakery treats i tried to give them an alternative  goliath disdainfully threw this alien snack on the floor as if to say if you dont have my regular snack ill just pass tonight  it is a bonus that these snacks are low fat  our precious fourlegged children just love them
5: my dogs expect these cookies every night before bed  i have moved alot and will only stay if i can get these blue dog cookies nearby  blue dog has a great website

5: ive purchased these in the past  my three shelties really love them  they have a scent of gingerbread to mebr br i often heat them for about ten seconds in the microwave  that softens them and i think brings out the flavorbr br i will continue buying these
5: i have been buying these peanut buttermolasses dog bisquits for several years now but can only find the two mixed varieties in the grocery stores mixed meat flavors and mixed cheese and meat flavors  my dogs get diarhhea from these other mixed versions  i know its the cheese flavors and maybe the liver my only complaint in buying them from you is that i had to buy 6 boxes at a time  please tell the groceries that it is ok to have mixed versions in the store but not to forget loyal buyers like me who want only the one kind  thanks for making such a good product that i would go to great lengths to contine them for my beloved pet  susan

5: since these treats are sized generously i break each one up into 3 or 4 pieces for my cavalier king charles and keep them in a plastic container in our pantry cooper loves them each time we tell him to kennel up go to his crate he eagerly waits in the crate for his treat in fact at bedtime he stares at me until ive opened the pantry door then he takes off to his crate with no urging and waits for his treat for us there is no question that this is a good purchase and have a regular subscription to keep them in stock
5: these treats are definitely my dogs favorite  they gobble these up and have started turning down other treats  they come in fun shapes and when you open them up they smell just like peanut butter  they smell so good ive been tempted to try them  the ingredients are wholesome and natural and i feel good about giving these to my dogs  i just wish more came in a box

5: my boxer loves these treats and i feel good about giving them to her as they are totally natural
5: i started buying those for my dog a few months ago my dog loves them so much that he will do anything to get one of them he learned so many new tricks because of thembr br one funny thing about them is that he gets a treat every time he goes outside to do the deed i noticed in the first few days we started giving those treats that he asks to go out every 20 minutes or so i thought the treats were giving him problems only to find out that he asks to go out so he can those treats when he gets back he even lefts his leg to pee and nothing comes because he peed so many times earlier
5: it smells goodbr my dog loves thisbr the price is rightbr and it has low fatbr what else can i say
5: these are really great treats for the dog they are healthy and natural i was fortunate to get these on sale i have a small stock saved up at home when i first opened these the dog went crazy his nose was high up in the air trying to figure out where the whiff was coming from these treats range from small to big they come in different animal shapes they look so good that i even felt like trying one

5: a hrefhttp
5: our three weenie dogs just love these bisquits must be the peanut butter thanks for healthy snacks
5: my dog loves these cookies  we give one to her for desert after she eats her dog food if we forget she reminds us  i really like giving healthy treats with no additives or preservatives  also love the fact that they are lowfat
5: my german shepherd absolutely loves these treats i feel great about this product because these biscuits are made with healthy ingredients  nothing artificial buying items from blue dog bakery on amazoncom is far more economical for me than purchasing them at a pet store
5: my two dogs love all of blue dog bakery treats they prefer them to other treats and seemingly cant get enough the natural ingredients are very impressive and i dont feel guilty giving them byproducts and ingredients i dont understand i especially like that they are produced in the us blue dog bakery also has a very nice newsletter if you wish to subscribe i highly recommend this product

5: these are the only dog treats i know of that smell like wonderful cookies for humans  it is hard to resist snacking on them myself  and my doggies love them  and the price is great  if you want some extra lovin from you pups this is a great snack to feed them
5: these smell good enought to eat  some ae big so we break them up for our dog

5: we found these at our local haggens  our three dogs love love love these cookies  i couldnt find the little ones at the grocery so i bought the big cookies  they are huge  ive ordered the little ones  your dog will go nuts for these
5: a hard to find item pleased to find it wamazon it became harder and harder to find this item retailbr happy with the quick delivery toobr just one drawback the biscuits were pretty crushed and broken  dont know who is to blamebr not ready to give up yet as we love the door to door delivery
5: so pleased to have found these dog biscuits the company states they are at all our local markets however that is not true grateful to this site they came faster than expected which was also to my delight thank you
2: my 2 dogs will accept these treats with a look of  and what am i supposed to do with this  they walk away slowly and then drop the biscuit  they do eat them but with distain  one of their least favorite treats
5: i used to get these just as a special treat for my dogsnow since they are delivered at a reduced price they get them every day  wonderful productgotta love that pb and molasses aroooo
5: great cookies  none of the sugar garbage and meat byproducts  our dog has been loving these for over 5 years
5: we found the blue dog pb cookies over 5 years ago at trader joes in the indianapolis area  they have since stopped carrying them east of the miss river sadly but other stores picked the product up  given a choice of every treat imaginable our dog will always pick the blue dog treatssmart dog  they are all natural low in fat and the aroma when you open the bag caused our grandson to ask if the cookies were for him  finding this bargain on amazon is a treasure and a great opportunity for newcomers to try a great product for their companion puppy
5: see my detailed review of the other flavorbr br excellent product high quality ingredientsbr br definitely recommend
1: im surprised at how many people have given these cookies a high rating  they are huge  one i just pulled out of the box is 3 inches long by 2 inches wide  i use treats to train my puppy and reward good behavior  the starmark clicker literature suggests using a treat the size of a navy bean  dogs dont really seem to have any concept of size and treats are for training not supplementing food  if i try to break these down in size a good part of the cookie turns into unusable crumbs  also important
5: grateful that this tea is available online its hard to find in stores  tea arrived even earlier than projected arrival date
5: bought this popcorn salt looking for an alternative to pouringdripping butter over freshly popped cornnothing worse than soggy popcorn  i have always loved the saltybuttery taste of the movie theater popcorn but couldnt find anything similar until now  this stuff is really delicious  the only complaint i have is that the container caplid has the double opening so that you can choose to just pour it on or choose to sprinkle it over the popcorn  unfortunately the sprinkle holes in this cap are huge so theres no sprinkling the salt around evenly it just pours out anyways  to remedy this situation weve purchased an extra salt shaker and just refill it when needed  that way we can get the popcorn salt sprinkled on evenly without overdoing it
4: after years of trying every popcorn maker in the world i had just about given up on getting theatertasting popcorn at home  this year i invested in a home version of the big popcorn machine you see at the multiplex  that got me halfway there but i was still dissatisfied with the final popcorn result because i could never get the buttersalt combination to work without ruining the texture of the popcorn and salt alone wouldnt stick to the kernelsbr br this item is the real deal  tastes exactly like the theater version and doesnt make a soggy mess of the popcorn like the popcorn toppings you can buy at the grocery store  the only thing wrong with this item is the size of the jug and the holes for the product to shake out  solve the issue easily by transferring a manageable amount into an extra salt shaker spice bottle or whatever i may not be able to finish the whole container before it reaches the expiration but for 15 i have prime so no shipping cost it was well worth it
3: i purchased this today and promptly fired off a batch of popcorn with 14 tsp of this stuff added to the popping oil  the flavor is movie theaterish but i still feel like im missing the full effect because im not popping in coconut oil  still this stuff delivered some of the flavor i was looking for and adhered to the popcorn just fine because i didnt use it as a sprinkling salt after the popping process was finished  honestly thoughthe price here on amazon is outrageous  i went to my local warehouse store that starts with an s and ends with an ams club and purchased the same sized jug for under 3 bucks plus tax
5: seriously it is the same stuff they use in theaters  if you ever visit the carmike 14 in tyler tx youll see big canisters of this stuff lying around the concession stand  my girlfriend and i love this stuff and she was elated that i was able to find it because for some reason they dont sell it in any retail stores around the dallas area
5: this buttery salt tastes just like what you find in the theaters however be careful of the spout  it pours very fast it would be better to buy a salt shaker for a more even controlled cover
4: we have had some of this that we received from a friend when we ran out we had to search to find it and the only place we could find was amazon it is great popcorn salt to use with wabash valley farms popcorn oil
5: i love popcorn and typically enjoy stovetop popcorn several times a week for supper i have tried many types of popcorn salt but have found the act ii to be the best several points that make this a superior popcorn salt first the salt is ground down to a very fine texture because of this it sticks very well to the popcorn it sticks better than regular salt and better than other popcorn salts i have tried the salt ends up on the popcorn and not in the bottom of the bowl second this seasoning has the perfect blend of saltbutter flavor the salt enhances the flavor of the popcorn perfectly creating that wonderful movie popcorn flavorbr br the key with this salt is to learn the proper proportion to shake on play around with it and you will fine tune the proportion to your taste and will then be enjoying movie popcorn at a small fraction of the price at the theater
5: just what i needed perfect toasty buttery tasting popcorn popping your own gives a flavor that is missing in the microwave type popcorn the only problem was the directions call for 1 12 tsp per batch in the oil i found it too salty and went to just 1 tsp per batch of popcorn and  did not need to add any more after it was popped next i need to try making it using the snappy brand coconut oil
3: my son is allergic to milk products  act ii butter flavor microwave popcorn is one of the only microwave popcorns he can eat  sadly the same buttery flavor in the form of this salt contains milk even though their microwave product doesntbr br i was going to combine this 5050 with flavorcol for the perfect popcorn salt  reason being is flavorcol is pretty mild and this stuff is pretty strongartificial tasting  if you really like the stenchflavor of the buttery topping at the theater youll love this stuff  if you want to get that movie theater taste but not go to overboard try mixing this with flavorcol  note flavorcol is very salty so you use less than you would normal salt
5: yeah buddy this is the stuff right here i picked some up at sams club and it makes such a difference on my popcorn i use the actual popcorn machine not a microwaved bag and after experimenting with butters and salt levels i can honestly say that movie theaters dont have anything on me if you like the salt they use at movie theaters this is spot on i will warn you though it comes out fast and its flavor is very strong so sprinkle with caution
5: the product is very good but there was a problem with the delivery  the container for the salt was damaged and the product was leaking into the packaging
5: i wasnt sure if i needed to buy specific butter flavored popcorn salt or if i could just use regular salt  i am thrilled that i bought this and it makes a huge difference  the oil is very important but the salt is critical as well for great tasting popcorn
1: i was excited to find this and read the great reviews  i ordered it at 15 from amazon and it does work and taste great in our large school popcorn maker however its offered for 348 at our local food warehouse  wow amazon is really making some money off this one  shop local before you buy this overpriced wonder
5: wow  this is the best popcorn topping i have bought to date and i am a popcorn junkie  it contains coconut oil just like they use in the theaters  label also lists milk and soy  i tried this two different ways when it arrived last nightbr br first i tried it on the stove  heated up just a little oil and put the kernels and about 2tsp of salt in a measuring cup  once the oil was added i threw the kernels and salt in covered it and it produced movie theater stylequality popcorn  i put some of the topping in a salt shaker to topbr br second i air popped some kernels sprayed them with canola oil and shook some of the topping on with a salt shaker  not as good by any standard but much healthier and among the best buttery air popcorn ive had without pouring a ton of butter onbr the jug will last me well beyond its expiration date its a lot of topping  for the price with the amazon prime shipping i couldnt be happier with this  if any of my friends make popcorn im going to give them some of this to use its awesome buttery salty goodnessbr br also not too bad on veggies if you like that salty buttery flavor
2: my wife and i like the act ii microwave popcorn that you used to be able to buy in the microwaveable bags at   recently we saw this and decided to try it  there are some problems  first it is almost impossible to not get too much on  the dispenser is made to use with a huge machine not a family size microwave popper  i finally had to put it on with my fingers  even then i had to be very careful because it was very easy to get too much on  i probably used a 14 teaspoon total and that seemed to be a little much  we had to sift our popcorn too to get it to work right at all  this container will easily last us 100 years or more and that brings us to the second problem  they need to sell this in a smaller size and with a much better dispenser that allows you to control how much comes out  it is gaggingly salty if you arent extremely careful
5: we love this butter popcorn salt  we have hot air popcorn often and it taste great
3: it is my fault i should have checked closer but shipping was more than the product  the salt itself is great but i would never have ordered had i caught the shipping costs
2: if you like buttered popcorn with popcorn salt but are looking for a healthier alternative you should keep on looking  the buttery taste is off with a distinct chemical taste  i used it twice gave it away to a neighbor who used it once and threw it away  ill stick to popcorn salt and i cant believe its not butter spray
5: this is just to give everyone an idea of how long this will last  my wife and i pop corn every other friday for our kids elementary school  on average we pop 320 8 bags every other friday  640 bags a month x 10 months of school6400 8 bags  we are just about to start our second bottle since the start of school midaugust  figure in a few spills and a few bad pops now and then  this could last a lifetime for some people  im thinking that the price here may be a mistaketypo  we buy this at the local megamart for 375br br i brought some of this home for a test  i was unable to make the popcorn we use at home to taste like the stuff we use a school  the school has a real theater popper not a toy coconut oil and we buy an expensive hybrid white popcorn  i tried some store bought name brand on the stovetop with the salt and coconut oil  just not the same  im convinced its the heating element in the theater popper  i can pop a cup of corn in moments at school but at home its definitely slower  i dont have the thick walled steel container to hold the heat nor the giant heating element  when popping at home the popped corn just sits inside the popper until all is finished popping  when popping at school the popped corn gets pushed out as its being popped so it doesnt sit inside the container getting steamed heated or overcooked burned etcbr br tastes just fine  nice fine crystals for an even spread on the popcorn
1: way too salty has an orange hue taste that is discussting bought obviously on the good reviews worst seasoning product i ever tried avoid this
5: the popcorn salt is great it is not available in this area so i had to go on line excellent delivery
4: first let me say that i love the way this popcorn tastes i like it better than any other popcorn but sadly when you eat it the butter screws with your taste buds for instance i drank apple juice while eating this popcorn and it tasted like poison i thought my apple juice was rotten i drank some later and it tasted fine
4: i am a starbucks coffee drinker for the most part i enjoy espressro roast sumatra french roast and even pikesbr br i needed a bag of coffee and decided to try something else to see if another brand of coffee would please me as much as the starbucks coffees that ive been enjoyng  so i picked up a pound of green mountain french roast whole bean coffee to be ground and used in my keurig i was pleasantly surprised the coffee was good and fairly strong and did not have quite as much as the burnt type taste that i sense and like in the starbucks french roast i definitely liked the flavor and would buy again its different than my usual but enjoyablebr br the beans are quite oily which is typical for french roast coffee beans they tend to sitck a little bit going through my burr grinder and i ocassionally have to give my grinder a tap or two to get the beans feeding again not a reason to not try this coffee just an observation
5: these are really great i got them to have a healthy nut snack and they fit the bill that theyre organic is a great plus
5: i really like the quality of this product everyone that has tried them asks me where i got them from the only thing that would make them better is if it was clearly stated where the almonds are from i do not wish to purchase almonds grown in the us due to certain californiafederal laws
4: im not sure why i dont think these are great they are just not as flavorful as the blue diamond almonds however they are good and make a fine snack i am having them even now i will trade good for great if i am eating almonds that are better for me than those i bought at kroger
2: this was partly my fault for not reading the description properly but these seem quite expensive compared to some of the other products perhaps nonorganic sold on amazon ie you can get 4 pounds of natural almonds for about 1 less than what you pay for 1 pound of this product quality is good but i wont be buying them again
5: i have one dog that has a lot of food allergies  these treats are the best  they are yummy and they keep my dogs skin looking perfect  we worked so hard to find a balance of foods for this dog to keep his skin clear and these veggie madness treats have been a big part of that  all dogs will love them i have a total of four dogs and i give these to all of them even the pickyeater yes there are picky eaters in the dog world loves them
1: i read the reviews posted on this site and figured id give shed stop a try my wife and i have a black pug that sheds like crazy so far we have been using the product for three months or so and have seen absolutely no change in the amount of shedding we have hardwood and tile floors so we can easily see the hair our beloved pet leaves behind before using shed stop we would vacuum three times a week now after several bottles of this product my wife and i vacuumthree times a weekbr br we recently found out that my wifes parents use shed stop on their very fluffy cat they have decided to stop buying the product because they too have noticed no change in the shedding personally i think they should just get rid of the cat im a dog guy myselfbr br maybe this product works for some of you out there or maybe there are a bunch of people who work for the company planting fake reviews on the internet i dont know but i do know this the stuff didnt work at all for us i have to go now its time to vacuumand then i think im going to wax my dog
5: i heard this product worked miracles and it has proven it to me  our yellow lab didnt shed that badly but we noticed we had to dust a little more well alot more with her in our home a friend who has 4 labs told us about this and he said it cut the hair problem by 34 and for us at least it has done that  and she loves the taste  we also give it to our cocker spaniel and it has given him a nice shinny coat  its vitamins andn minerals so its not bad for them  we highly recommend it to everyone we know who has a dog that shedsbr at least try it for a couple of weeks and see  i think youll be amazed as we werebr rachel
5: this product has made a tremendous difference in my household  i own 3 pugs  if anyone owns one pug they know how much they shed  i started all three on the shed stop and it was like a miracle overnight  the dogs absolutely love the taste too  i wholeheartedly indorse this product
5: they have a saying about dalmatians they shed twice a year
1: i have used all three bottles acording to the directions it did not even slow down the sheding at all that i can see it was a waste of money my dog loved the flavor but it smells like long dead fish really bad
5: the english bulldog is probably the best pet man can have but the hair loss due to shedding causes him to be less than perfect  if you have been around an english bulldog you certainly know the meaning of shedding dog hair  you dont play with the dog before going out for the evening thats for certain  theo the bulldog was given shed solutions  skin  coat supplement and what a difference in just a couple of weeks  now after a month he sheds very little  he has become a delight to have around  daily vacuuming is no longer needed my english bulldog is now the perfect pet and mans best friend no doubts  thank you shed solution
5: i have a norweigan elkhound and he generally sheds an incredible amount especially in the spring  i started him on the shed stop 4 weeks ago and it is just amazing how much of a difference im seeing  his shedding has really diminished and his coat looks great
3: there used to be a product called mrs allens stop shed there were separate products for dogs and cats in march of 2006 farnam pet products announced that it had acquired mrs allens shedstop from stabar enterprises inc once acquired farnam changed the stop shed name to shed solutions and then discontinued the one specifically for cats this is a case where a company acquires a productbrand in this case mrs allens and messes a good thing up i used the original products on dogs and cats for years and they were terrific i emailed the farnam in december of 2010 and explained my frustration that they no longer produced and sold the product made specifically for cats and was politely told to go elsewhere for my cat shedding problem so now i use the shed solutions for dogs for our family dog and cat they both seem to like the favor and it does help is it as good as the old product i dont think so but it definitely helps we are stuck with this product until farnam dusts off the original formula and offers one for dogs and cats or mrs allen comes out of retirement
5: i am highly allergic to dogs but i wouldnt trade mine for the world he is truley mans bestfriend so i had to find a solution for this boxers shedding it was getting out of control i found this and within the first week i noticed a huge cutback in the hair around the house thank you shedstop this is definately the way to go in the case of eliminating all that unwanted pet hair hats off to you shedstop
5: this is the best product ive found for controling shedding on my  german shepherdsbr the dogs love it and it makes a major difference in the amount of hair around the housebr br the company ships very quickly and i am happy to have found them and the product
4: this product seems to be working as advertised  my dog who shed his weight in hair every day i swear still sheds  but not nearly as much  i only wish that it 100 could cure shedding but i am sure that is not possible  it does work as advertised  i do not like the smell  but no matter  duffy likes it
3: i use this stuff because it has a really high content of vitamins i have an older dog who eats everything so my vet recommended some type of shedding stuff because of the vitamin content  i dont know if it helps stop shedding i havent really noticed a change  it must taste good too because my little pup inhales her food with this stuff on it  do not buy this in the store one bottle is the same price as all 3 of these we go through it so fast i love purchasing online
5: this is a great item and it really works i have seen such a difference onbr my brussels griffon will not be without it anymore she really does love it too
5: as an animal caregiver it was a pleasure to come across the shed stop for dogs productbr currently we have 3 german shepherds on the farm all of whom come into the house on a regular basis the hair they were shedding continually just about drove us crazyit was impossible to keep the house looking fit for companybr within just a few days of starting the dogs on shed stop the amount of hair left behind became noticably less within two weeks we were able to claim the house back for human use the dogs coats look beautiful and the constant shedding has all but stopped what a great product
5: the shed stop makes a big difference in my dogs coat they look healthier and shinier and shed less its a great product
5: ahmad english afternoon tea is the best i love to sample delicious teas from all over the world i orginally bought a tin of ahmad tea as a gift for a discount at marshalls around christmas time in 2001 i had so many selections for the gift basket i was making that i ended up keeping the ahmad for myself boy was i ever glad i did i havent found ahmad teas in any store since then ive been ordering it online ever since and refilling the authentic tin it originally came in during my breast cancer treatment chemo radiation  all that good stuff in early 2005 i was able to enjoy ahmad english afternoon tea even when i couldnt keep anything else down
5: this lovely full bodied tea is rich not bitter and when brewed just a bit longer than most teas require it will lovingly please your palet
5: this tea will not fail to please you  its a beautiful orange colored tea when cupped fragrant medium bodied never bitter and the bergamot is used in a classic european way  despite the pleasantly strong aroma of bergamot when the tea is dry it plays more of a subtle nuance flavor in this tea once brewed giving the tea a more layered flavor profile  not a highly aromatic earl grey tea in the americancanadian tradition for those looking for something strong  i can drink cup after cup of this pleasant tea all afternoonevening long and ive not tired of it yet  a very good value given the quality  i usually stick to loose leaf teas but this is my one exception  thank you ahmad for this gem
5: my wife loves this tea had it when we traveled to london we had it in our hotel room bought it for a suprise and had to buy more the tins are nice too
5: this is a high quality dog food and i have just opened the second bag for my dogs miniature pinschers for the past year they have had bad allergies and we catch them constantly chewing on their paws a pet store employee recommend this brand to us and we found it on amazon for much cheaper my dogs have also lost weight on this product and ive increased the amount i feed them by 25 their weight is ideal now allergies are gone and their coats appearances are much improved i highly recommend that if you love your dog you buy this
5: i was looking for a higher quality food for my 2 small dogs  this food has alleviated 2 huge issues for me  my pomeranian has a history of stomach problems and finding something for him to eat that would not upset his stomach was a challenge  immediately i could tell a difference with this food  he has not had one instance of loose stool or any throwing up since he has switched over 1 year and counting  my mixed breed always had overactive anal glands  within 2 months the carpet scooting ceased and he now only goes to the groomer every 3 months instead of monthly
5: my dog goes through blue buffalo food quickly  i used to have trouble with him eating because he seemed to be picky but since i bought this product i dont have to coax him to eat
5: i have noticed a big difference in both of my dogs since they started eating this dog food my pugterrier mix had thinning wiry fur  her skin was inflamed her fur has really thickened  her skin is better both dogs dont eat as much either they use to eat in the morning  evening but now eat only late afternoon the food does seem a little expensive but since they have cut down eating so much it probably balances out to what i was spending with store bought food
5: i ordered the blue buffalo dry dog food for small breeds based on the reviews saying how much small dogs who are finicky eaters loved it  i had my doubts  however our two little dogs actually lick the bowls clean  i dont have to try to make gravy just put it in their bowls and they eat  i also feel  good i am giving them a good quality dog food which will keep them healthy  excellent product
5: my dogs are healthier have better coats and less digestive issues on this food i love getting it from amazon fast free delivery and costs less than the local pet store
5: this product is for people who are serious about sour candythose who find sour patch kids to be very sour will find this to be unbearably so  i enjoy eating lemons and limes straight and drinking lemon juice by itself and i love this product  the actual fruit flavors watermelon blue raspberry green apple are fake and a little funny tasting but really those are in the background the main flavor you get is pure delicious sour  if you have eaten a warheads hard candy this is about the intensity of the very outside coatingagain those who like milder sour flavors will probably find this too muchthose who are often disappointed by sour candy that can never seem to be sour enough will love it  it does burn your tongue if you use too much though which is all right because it is a little pricey and i would go through far too many if i physically could  if you are looking for intense sour flavor i highly recommend this  if you arent as hardcore about your sour candy or you are looking for the fruit flavor look elsewhere
1: this coffee is bland burnt and just all around horrible  once starbucks left the queue gevalia just doesnt compete
4: i had bought a box of morning roast coffeewhich was either missent or stolen from my porch i notified the company and after a quick trace stating it was delivered i had to call to see how this company would honor their responsibiltiesbr i am very happy to tell you that they appreciately sent another box of tassimo morning roastbr br thank you so much for a very strong ethical response to this situation br br sincerelybr bill frederick
5: pros
5: i bought these to throw in the counter and sell at our store to make some change  i sold the whole box almost immediately and continue to subscribe to these  at a quarter for two we are making money and keeping the drawer stocked with quarters exactly what we wantedbr br the only thing i will point out is that these are not a super sized version of the ones you buy in the 1 oz pouches imagine one of those squashed to he less thick and more spread out  its not a big deal but i was expecting them to look as they do on the box and they do not  plus the pink and green colors are swirled and do not look like a little watermelon except in shapebr br just picky things so i am still giving five stars because they are a great seller and a great value
5: i got these for my sisters 6th grade class to pass out for trivia or rewardsbut i tried one i ended up signing up for the 6 month autoshipment they are really good more sweet than the tart if that makes sense to you cant purchase them around here so amazon comes through again
5: not much to say other than these are amazing  what is there not to like about oversized sour patch watermelons the fact that they are individually wrapped can help you ration it seemed this did not work on me however as i devoured the box in a couple of weeks  even with a sore tongue and a temporary lack of taste buds i highly recommend this product  also great price in my opinion
5: came fresh and ontime individuals packs are great for goody bags welcome totes or for candy jars will order again when i am done eating my current stash
5: i ordered this to use as a white elephant gift for christmas it was a big success and everyone had their eye on it the individual wrapped pieces were easy to share with the crowd im sure more will show up next year
5: yes im soooooo happy my candy has arrived feel like a kid in the candi store mouth watering in perfect condition no im not sharing lol
1: i know im responsible for what i buy and who i buy it from but i highly reccomend you guys watch out when you buy this item i wont go into details but this item took money from my debit card
1: the quality of the food has declined drastically  my 3 cats refused to eat no more than 3 bits of the food  looks like a more water downed version of potted meat
4: i have to rotate cat food now that my cats are more than 15 years old  they like to change every 7  10 days so i keep three different kinds on hand  this is one of their favorites
5: earths best baby foodbr my favorite brand of baby food by far both my son who is now over 2 years old and my daughter now almost one have used a wide variety of foods from earths best i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic andor locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal ive tried many varieties including store brands and others only available through internet purchase and found that earths best is by far the best for your moneybr br apples 4oz sizebr this is a great product and flavor its basic almost every baby i know loves apples and the size is so much better because its just big enough on the rare occasion that my son or daughter cantcouldnt finish in one sitting i could put it in the fridge until the next time they sat down to eat the price is great too especially if you sign up for a subscription i like it because if i need another set sooner than it would normally ship i can alter that in my subscription listing it makes this a great value and a great product
5: weve been buying these in bulk for months  my son loves these apples and if there is another food he is not enjoying we just mix in some of these apples and he gobbles it all up  its a magic mixin
5: our 7 month old loves these apples we try to buy as much organic as possible so its nice to have multiple earths best options that our baby lovesbr br pros
1: these candy bars were old and stale  i should have been able to return them they were not eatable  i am very turned off by your store now  i want my money back
5: i bought several bottles of pickapeppa sauce on my recent trip home and picked up a single bottle of this as an afterthought today i had it for the first time with tuna canned tuna blecch it made the tuna delicious so much so that i ate the whole can then i despaired that i would never find it in the us until i searched amazon thank you pickapeppa seller on amazon now i can continue on my healthy eating journey with the help of this tasty sauce
5: gluten free natuals makes the best glutenfree products ive ever had  the pizza mix actually tastes like a wheatbased pizza should taste  and what is even better it is relatively easy to put together  ive made glutenfree pizza crust from scratch and it is a major pain  and it doesnt come close to what i get when i use glutenfree naturals pizza mix  i heartily recommend this brand to anyone who needs a glutenfree product  their brownie mix is to die for  it compares favorably with the best of wheatbased brownies
5: its somewhat hard to find a macadamia syrup but i happen to love this particular flavor  my first order off amazon of a different brand broke and was then discontinued so i gave this one a try and im happy i did  its quite tasty and comes with a pump which is a nice touch  there are quite a few servings in each bottle and its perfect for italian soda  also from a practical standpoint they are using plastic bottles for the shipped product which makes it much less likely to break in transit
5: this is a very good dog treat for dogs with allergy issues  molly is willing to eat this although she prefers the treats i cannot give her due to allergy issues  it is difficult to find treatsfood that she likes  however this one seems to agree with her very well
4: this is a pretty good sauce i actually put it on all my turkey sandwichesbr br its not spicey at all
5: when it comes to bbq sauce i am never without it during cookout season  i use it on everything from pork chops to chicken and am usually not all that fussy about what i use  oh i know that some sauces are probably much better than others especially the higher priced brands  but when it comes to grilling i love to generously season my meat anyway and the sauce is never the all that ends all  recently i picked up this baby rays sauce at a local aldis market at a price that was cheaper than here on amazon and am enjoying it very much  it is very rich tangy and has a an all around great spicy taste  its definitely a step up from the cheaper generic and store brands available for a little cheaper  if you have an aldis around your area i highly recommend it  if not you can try it here on amazon where the price is still a decent bargain when bundled for free shipping darn good sauce
3: ive been a fan of instant miso for quite a while but this is the first time ive tried sushi chefs  it as with all other brands is simple and quick to prepare  the photo ive posted of the back of the package with its contents in a bowl really doesnt do justice to how much the freeze dried ingredients expand and come back to life in water  i like it more then the kikkoman soup which is locally available and contains msg but not as much as the sanj  the only problem i have with this soup is it is far too salty  at 910mg 38dv it just tastes too salty i normally make it with a 15 cups of water which helps but afterwords i still need to drink a large glass of water to keep from feeling like i have hypertension  that said none of the packaged soups can compare with making it from paste like in a restaurant if it did then no one would bother making it the hard way  the packets are lower quailty higher convenience
5: if you have health concerns with sodium or else are just afraid of it you may want to stay away if however you want a delicious and surprisingly filling cup of unbelievably flavorful soup this is what you want it doesnt smell like much but when it hits your tongue it becomes amazing and filling perfect for a meal after shoveling snow
4: i love this miso soup  it doesnt taste exactly like the kind you get at a japanese restaurant but it has a great flavor i like to add fresh ingredients to make it heartierbr good stuff will buy again
4: i heard miso soup is good for you so i picked up a couple envelopes at my local grocer  i have never seen it since at my local store so i ordered it from amazon  its pretty good too  my daughter has it for a quick lunch at her desk  i had to reorder  its good for a snack in the evening when you want a little something
5: this is the best instant miso for the price ive tried all of them and this is the best bang for your buck besides making the real stuff which would be a huge pain
4: this is the first time ive ever had miso soup and this was pretty good needed something to eat when i got home and did not want to eat anything too heavy and this filled me upit did not taste salty to me
4: the taste of this soup is really great to me it tastes just as good as those at japanese restaurants the price here on amazon is high though i thought for a bulk pack of 24 id find it cheaper here but its less expensive at my grocery store big y single pack  129 worth it on a cold winter day  add extra mushrooms for the best taste
2: i was thinking this was a nice low calorie snack but im sorry  38 of your sodium in one little packet is obscene  not to mention that it tastes too salty  it overpowers any other flavor that this soup might have  very disappointing  they should offer a low sodium option that might be more palatable
3: the machine came with a small crack under the first candy knob and it arrived later than advertised and it also didnt come with the screws needed to attach the candy tray to the bottom i have been having a hard time finding the right type and size screws at home depot
3: the product works fine as a black mustard seed in my seasonings but unlike the image on amazon the jar arrived only about half full  it may be that the product is sold by weight and that amount was in the jar but i dont think so  if thats the case the amazon link should state as much
5: i got one of these for my dog for a christmas present a few years ago it immediately became her favorite toy if there are several toys on the floor shell always go for this first shes a fifty pound golden retriever and border collie mix she doesnt have a great toy drive but this is ideal for her one of these lasts her about six month
5: my dog loves this toy  he destroys other toys within seconds to minutes at most  this toy is the exception  i have ordered several and set them aside for treats  yes he does eventually bite the fuzz off the tennis balls and then proceed to bite through them but this takes days or even weeks
5: i have an 11 month old great pyr he eats everything this 6 pack will keep him occupied for a couple of months he destoyed one in one hour but has managed to play with the second for two weeks now wo destroying it
3: the lozenges taste fine and do help a little with a cough  however i can not believe these are made with cane sugar and brown rice syrup and honey they are very sweet and just dont need to be yesthey are organic and not used very often which is good cause we wouldnt have any teeth left after all the sweetners  the front of the box says no added glucose like it would matter very slick marketing im so busy watching for gmosgluten and allergins that i forgot to look at sugar content i was thinking honey would be the main sweetner but i will check ingredients better from now on nice that they are individualy wrapped though
5: span classtiny length
5: i have a 9 year old pomeranian  i have always fed her the best food i could find and most of her life she had venison fresh and vitamins to make sure she got all the vitamins and minerals she needs  i dont get alot of venison these days so  my lucky little buddy gets canned dog food now and seeing how i think it is my responsibility to feed my little dog the most nutritious food i can find she gets blue buffalo  she absolutely loves this food  she has never been so excited about dinner  she practically opens the cans  it was almost immediately that i noticed her spunk return  she now runs and plays again like when she was younger  i love seeing her so lively again  she has been eating the duck but today we are getting a second flavor so she can have a selection  i wish they came in a mixed case  that way she could enjoy all the different flavors and get to have something different each day  like i do  like other reviewers i noticed after starting on the blue buffalo that she has less waste and her waste does not smell as bad as it used to  i am happy to feed her something that is obviously good for her that she clearly loves  i hope she is around many more years enjoying her blue buffalo
5: our dog absolutely loves this brand blue buffalo beef stew canned food it has generous vegetables and beef chunks in itit does not have an odor like cheap dog foods when you open the cansince putting our cats and dog on blue buffalo foods they are much leaner satisfied and do not have a dog smell or stinky cat litterthey are soooo much healthierthe cats are also on blue buffalo canned and dry food and our dog eats the dry food for puppies as well it seems a little pricey to some but like i have explained in the 9 months our animals have been on it the cats lost a lot of the extra weight they were carrying one is 1312 2 12 and 1 12 years old the older ones have much more energy and play more with the younger ones the dog is lean and fasthe is almost 1 year old shepherd  husky mix and american bulldog and he weighs about 50 1bs they all dont eat as much food and it is really cheaper in the long run as we were buying more of the cheap canned  dry food altogether than we buy now
5: we really like the stew in this house good stuff that gets inhaled when eaten my previous reviews indicate my love for blue and this is no exception 4 paws up from us
5: i was impressed by this canned food when i served it for the first time yesterdaybr our fussy dog gobbled it up and licked her bowl for several minutes after it was gonebr guess she was complementing the chefbr she didnt suffer any gas or other issues and its a brand i feel good about feeding herbr thumbs up
5: the stew is a fan favorite in our house all four large dogs love this stuff and their mama appreciates how healthy the dogs are blue fans for life
5: we use this syrup to make habanero lime margaritas and they are delicious  i highly recommend using this syrup for margaritas or other drinks everyone we have made them for have love them also
5: i thought i knew how to make a good margarita then we made a trip to marfa for our sons wedding and the bartender introduced us to the habantildeero lime syrup it makes all the difference between a hohum ok drink and a wowzer ritabr i ordered 4 on amazoncom and with my prime free shipping it was a bargain to boot
5: if you like lime spice and beer do yourself a favor and try one mix one mexican lager we actually use bud light lime and a 1 to 2 ounce pour of this product mix and booya i actually slice a jalapeno and gently crush a large sprig of clantro for garnigh and aroma best summertime drink ever imo
5: i pour a shot of this stuff into my corona beer on ice  i first discovered this chelada drink recipe while having dinner at the house of blues  its also great mixed with johnny black label on the rocks  love the spicy aftertaste
5: this is absolutely delicious my husband has had it on vanilla ice cream every night since it arrived just the right blend of chocolate and raspberry
5: update june 2009
5: i do not even care if this is overpriced these are absolutely delicious theres not a ton of meat in each package but it hits the spot good lord these taste so delicious i do not even know what more to say
5: best one yetif you have not tried this one yet your missing out very tender and moist nuggetsthe only negative is the 325 size bag is much to small
5: i bought these to share with the office and the disappeared almost instantly  they are very good and contain enough protein to keep people going while suppressing that snacky feeling  these are a great snack to carry with you as they are very light for example on a flight or road trip  i highly recommend that you try a few of the other flavors as well  they have this snack in chicken turkey and beef in various flavors
1: i am an avid consumer of jack links beef steak nuggets  this batch is stale dry and almost tasteless  i can purchase these in even remote gas stations and they taste juicy and wonderful i am too lazy to return them but will never buy them over the internet again
4: i cant give these a 5 because the ingredients show they are very processed  im not sure how healthy they arebr br but the taste is great  very hot   like about a nuclear on the zaxbys scale  if you like hot wings youll like these  be prepared to not be able to leave them alone  when my husband buys a bag we sit there and eat them until they are gone  also have something to drink handy
3: i was expected a lot better i love the beef jerkey nuggets they are so juicy n flavorful and delicious but when i ordered these just to try them cause i couldnt find them in any store i wasnt too happy when i tried them they were extremely greasy and not that much flavor
2: ordered oven roasted turkey nuggets for the first time meat is dry expiration date is too close received today sept 9 2011 expiring nov 21 2011br br in the past have had very good experience with the chicken teriyaki nuggets jack links used to use dark meat jack links changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any morebr br  very disappointed with amazons approach on linking all jack links nuggets together meaning
5: these are the typical red bags of premium beefjerky you see at the store onlyyou get four of them these four bags of delicious mouthwatering beef nuggets are a tasty and healthy snack and i dont feel bad about eating a whole bag throughout the day at my deskbr br i love all of the varieties jack links has to offer ive been a diehard teriyaki fan myself so im hesitant to sway away from my typical goto bagbr br if youre looking for a satisfying feelgood snack to take on road trips sporting events at your desk or whathaveyou  you do not want to pass this up
4: these are pretty good but a little overpriced  i would only buy if there was a promotion some pieces are deliciously tender and seasoned perfectly but there usually are more that are too dried out and tough or overseasoned
5: these are great  they are spicy but not too spicy  they taste just like buffalo hot wings but without the bones i agree with another reviewer who is thinking about microwaving these as i bet these would taste even better warmed up  i bought an 8 pack of these and keep these at my job for when i get the munchies and want some quick protein and the calories for one bag is only about 280 so that is perfect for a snack or to ward away the hunger pangs  these would be great for someone doing a lowcarb diet or someone who just wants extra protein for their body  one bag also has just over 30 grams of protein and this tastes so much better than eating just a protein bar  bottom line is this if you love hot wings and cant get enough give these a try  you wont be disappointed
5: i just tried these recently and i cant get enough of them now  they dont have the texture of buffalo chicken wings its more like the stuff you get when you order a buffalo chicken pizzajust chunks of plain old chicken smothered in hot sauce  havent tried it yet but they seem like theyd be really good warmed up or tossed on a pizza before it goes into the ovenbr br they seem to be a bit more expensive than other jack link stuff but so worth it  om nom nom nom nom
1: i wanted to get some jerky and since i like buffalo wings i tried these the problem is there is way too much salt its disgustingly salty way more than normal jerky i can barely eat it if you eat a 325 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium instant high blood pressure
5: i was a bit apprehensive ordering these from amazon because i had read in other reviews that some of the jerky were moldy i am happy to say that mine were absolutely moldfree my family vanquished 2 packets on the spot lol
5: absolutely love these steak nuggets everywhere around here they go for over 8 dollars so i was thrilled when i found out i could buy these on here very tender and the spices are amazing
5: little morsels of moist pure beef that taste like high quality roast  i got the teriyaki by accident  i normally dont like teriyaki anything  but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetnessbr br lean good cuts of meat with no nasty little gristley surprises  my only criticism is they must cook these in crack cocaine because im absolutely addicted to them
5: i love the steak nuggets and tenders even better than their regular jerky  i swear by all three of the original peppered and teriyaki beef flavors
3: im a big fan of buffalo chicken and beef jerky so i thought id love the jack links flamin buffalo chicken nuggets  i was wrong  i bought the steak nuggets as well which arent as good as jack links jerky but definitely tasted better than the buffalo chicken nuggetsbr to put it bluntly they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight buffalo flavor  theyre not very spicy i was expecting more of a kick  they also smelled a little funny  id give buffalo chicken jerky a try but i wont be buying these ever again theyre ok but theres so many better options out there
4: the beef nuggets are soft and easy on the teeth and tasty if they are slightly less salty they will be excellentvery good snackbr johnson
4: these were good but i really couldnt taste the a1 in them  tasted similar to the original steak nuggets to me
2: i would like to say that i have never tried a flavor of jerky that i didnt like  that was true until a few days ago  i wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef  this was a mistake i have to say this is the worst jerkynuggetsmeat product i have ever tried  from the smell to the taste just not good  if you really want to give this stuff a whirl i suggest you find a single pack  dont buy 4 of them like i did  one final note
5: i find that the buffalo chicken jerky is great for when im craving buffalo wings late at night sure theyre not the saucy goodness of wings at a bar but they definitely replicate the flavor they are very hot but delicious
5: i normally have beef jerkey with my lunch for some easy to transport protein i decided to give these a try bought them at the grocery store and they were great easy to measure and a lot less stringy than normal beef jerkeybr br i ended up saving a ton of money using amazons subscribe and save over using the grocery store definitely something ill reorder
5: i really like the product  it was super easy to order online and have it delivered  much cheaper than buying in a gas station  stocking up is good for long drives too
5: these taste amazing best jerky ive ever had they are kind of expensive but once in a while amazon will lower the price slightly and hopefully that happens when they are offering a 10 off jack links products promo code anyone who likes jerky or is simply looking for a convenient high protein snack should give these a try
5: the bite size chewables are wonderful  2 or 3 every few hours lets yu diet and never feel hungry
5: i purchased these to snack on after my workouts now i find myself just snacking on them all the time theyre really good and come in a variety of flavors
5: these are strangely addictive  and a good sugarless snack  i like this flavor and the original but the pepper is really strong  enjoy
5: flamin buffalo chick  a1 are my all time favorites the meat is tender and the taste based on the ones ive bought are extreme with flavor the only problem with jerky is the salt and these have a ton of it i wouldnt consume more then one bag a day but its your choice and body ill definitely be buying more in the future though because these are delicious
5: these are a great goto snackmeal when youre in a rush and dont want chips or hotdogsbr br the nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickelsbr br the flavor is spicy with a nice tangbr br the texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausagebr br quick comment on quantity  there are three servings 60 calories each in the package  this ends up being a little over a handful for the entire packagebr br great to have on hand for those on the go times
5: i love the beef teriyaki nuggets and the buffalo chicken nuggets now i have a 3rd kind to eat these are great tasting and easy to eat important for post bariatric surgery people i love jack links nuggets line
4: i love em  i would give this 5 stars but there arent enough in the bag to warrent that  they are good
1: oh my gosh these are gross i bought them because of hungry girls glowing recommendationand i gotta say she steered me wrong this time these are super salty and they taste like what i imagine dog kibbles would taste like
3: i actually really love the jack links original beef steak nuggets however the 4 pack i received seemed to be old  they werent nearly as good as the ones i have purchased in gas stations  makes you wonder why that would be these were tough and much drier then i expected i have to say i will not order them again through the mail if they had been fresher i would have rated them as i love them because i really do
1: dont buy these from amazon warehouse like i didtotal waste of money for these dry hunks of blandness  i wouldnt know what they are like fresh it wasnt sold to me that waybut at least my dog had dog chews  not sure why amazon insists on selling worthless food rather than throw it away and risk ticking off customers andor poisoning them  i know they are closer to the expiration date buying it through the warehouse but seriouslythrow bad food away amazon  sheesh
2: all and all it is my fault because i did not pay attention to what i ordered when i went to the jacks links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free at the time they did not have this product for purchase so when i received an email saying it was now available i hurried and ordered it it is not until i received the order did i realize i had ordered dark meat i did not even know that dark meat was available therefore i was shocked and felt deceived yet i had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty i did get a formal apology in writing from jacks links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention now i am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets in conclusion i guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef maybe
3: i dont eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice  bag is enormous for whats inside it  theres basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag and because of the sauce if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand youll end up with dirty hands  a much smaller bag would make sense  id also like to see more for the price  flavor is good
2: these are good but verrry sweet they taste kind of chinese sweet bbq sauce high protein
3: they have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers i bought these to eat while driving it it isnt going to work
5: very good tasting and high quality product you can really taste the difference between this and other more cheaper products
5: these are so flavorful and each type is significantly different from the others so you get a very nice selection buying the 4pack from amazon winds up being about half the price it would buying them individually from my local grocery which only carries one or two of the types available in this pack or even from the local health food market which doesnt have the couscous anyway where i live whole wheat couscous is hard to find  i would definitely recommend this sampler pack  ill buy another as soon as my husband and i can get through our firstthey last a long time so it is a great value
5: i really enjoy these rices  i live in a small town and dont have access to specialty items so it was really nice to be able to order these the shipping was pretty quick in my opinion and i plan on ordering again
5: i first bought the rice for my husband and myselfwe just enjoy them so much  i dress them up by adding small amounts of chicken summer sausageor meat  however we just enjoy them plain alsobr br have purchased the four jar assortment for gifts great productwill buy again and again
5: this is a great selection of rice and couscous i put in my rice cooker and have a healthy dinner or a side dish before i know it
5: this rice selection is delicious  we have enjoyed all four varieties and the containers are easy to store and use
5: i love that these come in 4 jars and not bags my family has enjoyed many a good meals
5: what a great selection of grains we love the different grains sometimes get tired of regular a hrefhttp
5: i very much enjoy this variety of rices  couscous excellent quality  taste these will be a staple in my kitchen i like them all but my favorite is the brown  red rice mix i recently made a dish with the brown  red rice mix that was out of this world delicious good stuff
5: excellent will buy again everything is fresh and the best is the variety
1: i dont know why it took me so long to write this  and i should have returned the package but i didnt open it right away and when i did i had to check all four of them rancid they smell awful they taste awful i cooked some to be sure and i have new riceselect products in my pantry now from the local grocery  and the difference is paramount i just wish i had returned it for a refund will never buy this online again no matter if im craving it
5: i bought this for my niece with a new rice cooker she says the rice is wonderful after all the cheap rice she has eaten in the last few years i agree this works well in rice cookers and is good quality rice i bought one container at a higher price at the local store and loved it the cous cous is good in the rice cooker steamer traycoffee filter under
4: this is a very toothsome collection of rices and whole wheat couscous in the sampler there is enough porduct to last a single person several months this is a purchase i will repeat
4: i like these products a lot buying from amazon saved 10 or so from the grocery store prices plus they were delivered directly to my house insteadbr br theres enough variety and quality here to keep you and your family interested in eating healthy rice and they dont require too much work to make a truly delicious meal i like it a lot
5: the texmati is really good ive tried all but the couscous so far and they all taste great
4: it tried the couscous as soon as my order came in and it is marvelous it is so good
5: with my purchase of this sampler pack i have now tried all the riceselect products on the market  they are all very tasty although i do prefer some to others and the grains are always of the highest quality i prefer my rice a little drier and use about 14 cup less water than suggested other than that i love this product
5: we are enjoying these unique combinations of flavors if you are tired of the same old brown rice and want something fun and flavorful you will enjoy this assortment
5: the riceselect sampler gave us a chance to not only receive the rice mixture that we know and love but to try the other wonderful varieties that they also offer  this product is perfect for anyone looking to add healthy substitutes to their diets
5: so easy to cook and the best tasting couscous everbr boil water add couscous cover with lid and take off heat let set 5 minutes fluff with fork and serve excellent  i add some sort ofbr beans navy or great northern some drained stewed tomatoes and whateverbr you like sometime add drained and rinsed green peas so quicka and easybr just be sure to rinse you canned or frozen veges a never ending varietybr of dinners and so healthy especially excellent when you add tofu
1: i sent this stuff to tara and she told me this  sorry to say this but my rice you sent has friends in it must been the hot weather i checked them all and they where full of little bugsand i cooked some good thing i saw them as the rice heated upgahhhhhhhbr br not happy with this orderbr br paul
1: i should say i loved it when i bought it a while ago but never looked so close at it my wife showed me a few very small bugs floating on the water in the rice cooker not going to send them back since i did used some of it and not worth the try hope that it was in a batch of it and the manufacturer can read and figure out this not going to buy it again
2: i recieved these as a gift from a friend who knows i love rice and grains ive been cooking grains forever i buy 20 lb bags of carolina or riceland rice for less than 0060 lb they are better tasting than these select rices and i fill them into my own canistersat about 450 per 2 lb jar how good do you expect this to be  yesthe jars are cute but i recycle similar jars from other foods that might otherwise be tossed in the garbage save your money its not worth it
5: theres a calming soothing quality to this tea the taste is potent and robust even though it is to put you to sleep  if you drink this 30 minutes before bed you will find yourself getting very very sleepy
5: i happened upon these organic soups at a new earth fare store that opened in our area wow theyre awesome the best canned soup ive tried im pregnant with our second child i had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy and im on a strict diabetic diet for this pregnancy these are great because the entire can falls within my allotted carb allowance for lunch or dinner the minestrone is the bomb when i cant cook something wholesome for myself  this organic soup really hits the spot i feel good about eating this because its organic id feel better if it didnt come in a tin can  but at least its organic ingredients i also tried the chicken and wild rice and its also phenomenal i will be heading back to that store to buy myself more of this soup it leaves me feeling full and warm in cold ohio winter weather and i make my postmeal blood glucose numbers i have not seen it in other stores i wasnt really looking  but i will be now
3: the cans i ordered are very dented the price is better than at the local health food stores in my area but i do not want dented cans
5: the only minestrone soup i will eatand the grocery stores in my area do not carry it  i am able to buy muir glen tomato sauce in charlotte ncbr   b stanley
3: i always stock a variety of items on my kitchen shelves that might be used as an instant lunch in times when im in a hurry and dont have any time to prepare things one of my longtime favorites is the maruchan instant lunch cups and i presently have the beef flavor they also come in several other flavors the cost is minimal theyre real easy to prepare real just peel back the top add hot water and let it set for about three minutes have a few things like cheese fruits meat along with your noodle soup and viola an instant lunch works real well and is tasty my only reservation is the very high salt sodium content its listed at 1200mg which is about 50 of the daily recommendation in one serving wow its an easy and quick lunch but youd better watch your other salt intakebr br gary peterson
5: product came right when expected and i get to enjoy the deliciousness every day it was well packed and none of the containers were deformed
5: these noodles are so quick and easy and perfect for busy moms those wanting to eat and dash out shopping during their lunch hour and those on a diet  ive eaten cup o noodles for years but these have the best flavor and most vegetables none of the cup o noodles have a lot of vegs  theyre also a great value
5: these are exactly what you might expect if you bought at the store i was pleased with the product and they made great party favors at my sons 3rd birthday party
5: awesome thomas pez dispensers we got these for our son 3rd birthday party and everyone loved them the lemon flavored candy was not very tasty but the kids ate it anyway would recommend for children of all ages
5: a little something special to have on hand  these ginger snaps are the perfect size for your purse when you need just a bite to keep you rolling  ever wait in an airport with a child  these may do the trick  great snack and nice individual wrapping
5: this was the second modern variation on an essentially unchanged bestselling product for more than 140 years  other flavors are
5: as far as im concerned a pizza just isnt worth eating unless its generously decorated with anchovies  however im the only one at our house who feels this waybr br   on weekend nights we frequently order in from our favorite pizza place and since i must have anchovies i keep these on hand to garnish my share of the pie  never would dream of imposing my educated taste on others  br br   weve tried other brands  the ones packed in oil tend to fall apart others have been tasteless  these have a rich flavor and are meaty enough to hold their shapes  theyre the best weve found
5: these anchovies are outstanding  we actually ordered these at approximately the same time we ordered nettuno anchovies from italy in a large jarbr br these are truly gourmet  terrific flavor and more importantly unlike the  italian anchovies packed in sea salt water in a large jar  these dont fall apartbr br in other words  when we reorder  these acciughe salate whole salted anchovies will definitely be on the very top of our list
3: i tried these anchovies after watching several cooking shows where the celebrity chef towted the amazing wonders of salt packed anchovies  so i ordered some  the taste is goodbut the work to get them there is a pain in the patoot  you have to rinse the anchovies then clean and gut them  they come as whole fish only the heads are lopped off  scales fins et all are still there they are small so cleaning enough for use is time consuming  then they must be soaked in milk or water for several hours  then when you go to use them you find you still need to clean them further as you may have missed scales or fins with the initial cleaning  like celebrity chefs if you have a kitchen assistant to do your grunt work then i recommend these anchovies  otherwise save yourself some extra work
4: the junior mint deluxe looks like and is about the size of the familar chocolate covered cherry here the similarity ends the dark chocolate shell is tasty and satisfying inside is a generous amount of creamy mint filling i cant take a bite without spilling some filling just hope it doesnt fall into any abdominal cavitiesbr br enjoy
5: i tried this stuff a while back and man i got easily hooked  regular coffee may as well be decaf for me now  good stuff
5: i have been receiving shock hypercaffeinated coffee through the subscription program of amazon for over 6 months  i love the fact that i dont have to remember to orderit just comes  the coffee is very good  it doesnt get bitter or taste funky  it says it is hypercaffeinated however i dont get jittery or sleepless when i fix it  i use the 1 tbsp4 oz cup of coffee formula  i drink about 12 pot and do not get an upset stomach  using this coffee i dont feel like i need to drink an entire pot to stay alert through the morning
5: probably just as strong as french roast starbucks coffee but you cant beat the price for the 3 packbr br works great in a drip maker or espresso pot
3: i have been waiting for years for someone to come out with highcaffeine coffee  i even bought the stok shots on amazon to add caffeine to each cup but it can change the flavor a little  so i could not wait to try this and bought three bags in one dealbr br the coffee is not bad  i am a coffee lover and this is basically a standard roast folgers quality  i like french roast and this is not a dark roast or high quality bean from what i can tell  i generally drink a pot each morning and this is not bad coffee  but i will be darned if i can tell the difference between hypercaffinated and regular coffee  maybe i am not a good subject as i drink so much coffee but you would think drinking an entire pot of hypercaffeinated coffee would give you quite the caffeine rush  it does not  so for anyone really looking for the rush of caffeine this review will not stop you but i suggest that if you can but a single bag instead of the three pack do it  then let us know what you think
5: this stuff really surprised me  not sure if the buzz is any stronger i always make my coffee strong  if its not pitch black i wont drink it  good flavor good smell and not expensive win win i say
5: this coffee truly does give you that extra burst of caffeine in every cup and is just what i wanted probably would not be good for someone with a heart condition also would not make for a good bedtime drink the flavor is good aroma is heavenly and i will be ordering more of this coffee
4: it is a good strong coffee but i wish that the  packages were vacumed sealed tighter than they are if you like really stong coffee without the bitter taste then this is the one for you
1: zzzzzzz i had high hopes for this coffee and have been really disappointed i say youre better off buying folgers and adding extra scoops to your filter then buying this i had to use a lot to get a strong cup of coffee and still went to sleep several times after drinking i think its over priced hype
5: looking for something to get your butt going  got a long week and your regular cup of joe just aint cutting it  then you got to try this stuff  it has become my new morning friend  ive tried a couple of hypercaffeinated coffee blends and shock is by far the best  the flavor is not to strong nor is it deeply intense and bitter like an espresso  a nice blend of flavor and acidity with that extra caffeine bump to get a work day started  i will say this if youre sensitive to caffeine this product is not for you  but if you like coffee and youre looking for that extra jolt to help things get started then buy yourself some shock
2: i dont mean no disrespect i quit buying shock coffee from amazon because it was a whole cheaper when i went to the website and thats where i will continue to buy it thankx anywayz
5: i use capers in many dishes including a meatless carpaccio lox with cream cheese and bagels and various salads and cold dishes see my customersupplied image at the top of the page for an examplebr br the problem and especially in the backwoods of central florida where i live is finding high quality capers there are a few brands that are acceptable to me but since discovering this brand i am a loyal customer for lifebr br key qualities of these include an excellent balance of acidity and saltiness a little bite but not obtrusive and of course crunchiness compared to some other brands i have tried many of which were very salty and not at all crunchy this one stands out and of course these are nonpareil grade instead of the gigantic capers that litter many supermarket shelvesbr br if you want a real treat use these with a hrefhttp
5: jello is jello but who wants to pay 119 per pkg at safwayget it delivered once every six months depending on use
5: this was great and it came fast everything was perfect this was great and it came fast everything was perfect
4: with work a new baby 16 months and all were a real busy couple meals can be a problem one of our solutions is to keep a goodly stock of pasta roni herbs and angle hair pasta is our favorite in our pantry we can fix up a batch in a matter of minutes add a vegetable or and meat heated in the microwave of course and the pasta roni makes up a nice complimentary side dish its not gourmet fare but its quick and easy very handy productbr br gary peterson
4: ok whats not to love about a meal you can make in about 10 minutes tastes darn good and is light on the wallet its not italian carryout by a long stretch but it gets the job done im a fan of this flavor although my wife prefers the a hrefhttp
5: earths best baby foodbr my favorite brand of baby food by far both my son who is now over 2 years old and my daughter now almost one have used a wide variety of foods from earths best i am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic andor locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth but i do not feel that all organic brands are equal ive tried many varieties including store brands and others only available through internet purchase and found that earths best is by far the best for your moneybr br antioxidant variety packbr weve loved this variety so far i never noticed it when my son was eating baby food but now my daughter has one at least once a day they tend to be a veggie heavy variety and my daughter would rather have veggies than fruit most days the only one in the variety she cant eat so far is the banana mango because of an allergy to mangos but im hoping to save those for a later date when she can tolerate it betterbr br the only thing i didnt like about this product was that when i initially was deciding to purchase it i couldnt find out what varieties were included in the pack so for your information they are
5: first since the photo is hard to see and the description doesnt list the flavors included they are
5: i live this variety the flavors with meat give me the creeps and none of these have meat the tomatocarrot is my sons favorite i used it as pasta sauce for him when he started eating finger food
3: earths best is great but the price for 12 of these is way too expensive  you can pick them up at whole foods babies r us  many other merchants for under 10
5: my daughter loves all of these flavours we love the earths best because they have an excellent variety and they actually taste good yes mom and dad have tried them as well
4: this is great food i bought it here to have it shipped to a vacation location but it is much cheaper in stores
5: my 8 month old baby loves the combinations  its great that shes getting the nutrients she needs too
5: id continue to buy but im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jarsshattered too many they like all the flavors though great textures too
5: my daughter loves earth best jar food she is very picky about the taste so their varity comes in very handy
5: wonderful for our 8 month old baby boy loved all the flavors super fast delivery to our door great deal
5: we like these because 1 they are organic and 2 they mix fruits and veggies together so baby gets the sweet taste of fruit which he prefers with the the extra health of veggies the carrot tomato is the least popular in our household and the sweet potato apricot is the most popular our boy especially liked these when he was a bit younger  as he gets older they seem to be a little too liquidy for him it would be nice if they made thicker purees however he still loves these and it is a great way for him to get his veggies we love the subscribe and save so they just show up at the door and i am not always having to run to the store to get them
5: my kid isnt a fussy eater by any means but he really loves this combinations they arent bad tasting even to an adult great price and a great product
5: the product is great my son loves all the flavors he couldnt get enough of it highly recommended
1: several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars jars are cheaper at walmart
5: this is a great product and so is the unfiltered version i use this almost daily as a drink four teaspoons lots of water and a little honey perhaps why it has to cost more than you pay in a physical store is beyond me considering you have to buy a whole case and then the shipping charges come on since im not a medical doctor i cant go into the specifics about how healthy its supposed to be but i would encourage you if you havent already to look up the literature on the alleged health benefits of apple cider vinegar
3: we are big fans of tea and unfortunately we wont buy this one again  the cranberry smells somewhat artificial like a cough syrup  great for iced tea but i just cant get past the smellbr 
4: i absolutely love this soup  throw in some fresh asparagus and it is awesome  the only problem i have with this product being sold on amazon is that they are charging almost the same price for this 16oz product per unit as you can get the 32oz for at the storebr br so if you can get this product at the store you are better off buying the large package especially when it is on sale then to buy it from amazon  sorry amazon but you missed the mark on pricing for this item love this website and buy from them often
2: ive had much tastier creamy potato soup for a much cheaper price  the other reviewer is right when stating amazons price is of the 32oz at the stores  the onion gave it an off taste and the texture wasnt as creamy as the others like carrot and tomato  andit was bland  too pricy for something so bland with such little nutritional value so high sodiumwhats the point  at least the carrot soups were high in vit abr br also beware
5: creamy full of flavor not too much salt eat this soup alone add ingredients for a meal or use it as a base for other meals like homemade
1: this is a great product but it is now in a new box different from the one shown  4 of the new boxes burst  during shipping because the packaging did not adequately protect its vulnerabilities 5 boxes had the plastic lids torn off the top but the seal seems intact for now  3 seem ok  until they fix the terrible packaging of the new soup box dont buy this unless you want to receive a cardboard box full of runny sticky soup and damaged soup boxes  the box that is shown here is similar to hemp milk boxes i bought from amazon that arrived in perfect shape  unfortunately i did not receive the potato soup in boxes like the one shown in the picture here
5: not only does this appear to be the lowestpriced blueberry cream flavored coffee on amazon but it is very very good  5 stars
5: a hrefhttp
4: i love blueberry coffee and this was very good but if you purchase do not get whole bean get it ground before they send it the oils in the flavoring make it tough on some grinders
3: this coffee is very good provided you make it stronger than you normally would the coffee smells and tastes like blueberries but remember to really use alot of beans
5: usually i prefer a tea thats more mellow or sweet but when i want to sit down with a serious green tea this is the one that i reach for
5: my 4 month old lab has been on this for about 2 months and loves it  i didnt want to feed her any chicken products so i opted for the lamb her coat is shiny and she has lots of energy if youre looking for an alternative to chickenbased puppy food i highly recommend this one
5: simply outstanding  i prefer low acid coffees given that i suffer from acid reflux  this coffee has outstanding flavor and is not bitter
5: ive been a chef now for over 18 years and was very skeptical about ordering coffee organic coffee for that matter online when we got it we immediately opened it and vacuum packed and portioned the coffee it comes in a 5lb bag  up until the very last bean they were all full of flavor and taste so much better than anything i have bought in a store  the roasting process does not burn the bean it simply brings out the wonderful volcanic aromas surrounding nicaragua
5: this coffee is very good i read the reviews on how the acidity is low and wont bother the stomach and it is true no indigestions or acidy burney feelingsbr we enjoy a cup or two each morning and we will order again makes wonderful ice coffee with left overs enjoy
5: it is flavorful and still very smooth even though we brew very strong coffee  we love that it is good for the workers fair trade good for the environment and ourselves organic and good for the wild life and ecosystem shade grown not to mention it is really cheap to boot  there is just nothing i can find wrong with this coffee  i will so note that it always smells like coffee when i open the bag and especially so when i grind it  i have never had gourmet nicaraguan coffee so i cant compare to that but compared to any other whole bean coffee i have bought this one is our favorite
5: i have not had coffee this good in a number of years i grind my beans before i brew a pot of coffee i store them at room temp i am surprised and impressed by this coffee
5: very good coffee  i use a french press and it still does not not leave any kind of unpleasant flavour as an aftertaste  however i find when you add a bit of half and half you can actually taste the subtle flavors of this coffee even better  a mild lighter roast coffee which actually means more caffeine  delicious
1: tried to save some money  horrible coffee looks wierd too  i am sticking to cafe ibis from now on for triple certified coffee  amazon was cool to eat the cost for me  i love amazon
1: i am a little disappointed that i have to drink 5 pounds of this stuff its not completely undrinkable but it is very bland i will not be ordering this again
4: this is good coffee easy on the stomach  the best part is that if you make a really strong pot of coffee it doesnt taste bitter  the roasting was firstrate without extra oil left on the beans  and its a very good buy for shadegrown fairtrade coffee
4: this is a very smooth coffee  i do prefer a stronger tasting darker roast so i will mix these beans with  a hrefhttp
1: this is probably the worst coffee i have ever had  it arrived stale odorless a bag of lifeless beans  it had absolutely no coffee smell when i opened the bag  i always grind my coffee fresh on the spot and there was no aroma from the ground beans  bad sign  the brewed product was equally lifeless  worse than ground folgers from a can  i returned it after the first cup my bad for ordering such a large bag but i have have had good luck with organic coffee and this seemed like a good deal  bland bland dead stuff maybe other reviewers received a fresh product  i dont see how anyone who enjoys coffee could like this stuff in the condition received by me
1: the beans i received had virtually no aroma when brewed the coffee smelled bad and tasted worse its the worst coffee ive ever had to amazons credit they gave me a refund when i wrote them about it
1: i have been to nicaragua and i have had real organic coffee there some of the best was by workers in the vicinity of esteli  real nicaraguan coffee is earthy and fragrant with low bitterness and acidity  one can thus jack up the quantity of coffee per pot and get as intense a flavor as one wants with no downsidebr br i purchased this product with great excitement after the bags of coffee i took from nicaragua were finished  i was dreadfully disappointed  indeed i would say that this is as close as i can tell antinicaraguan coffee  it has none of that earthiness and fragrance but plenty of bitterness and acidity  it is completely in other words lacking in character  indeed i think this is closer to folgers than to gourmet coffee of any kindbr br i am aware that negative reviews tend to get panned  but i want to make clear that i sought as was given a refund for this unrefundable product  i said at the time that i would be posting a negative review to steer others away from this productbr br i will try with some other brand of nicaraguan coffee in the future  maybe ill just prepay to have the real stuff sent to me from that country
5: errrr i hate to tell you folks this but this is made from the whole leaf lol check out the sweetleaf website this one is made more for topical applications it wont hurt to drink it because it doesnt have anything harmful in it but its more for skin irritations and such that may be why you guys didnt like it in beveragesbr br this dark concentrate is renowned for its ability to soften skin and help to smooth out wrinkles just apply and after 30 to 60 minutes wash it away its worth trying on any skin problem youll be amazedbr br  unrefined whole leaf concentrate made with waterbr  helps pancreasbr  may help regulate blood sugar levelsbr  can be used as a topical agent for blemishesbr br its still sweet and you could use it that way but since its made from the whole leaf all those great plant phenols and stuff are flavoring the coffeebr br its a very easy mistake to make with steviabr br having said that ill say this sweetleaf is the only company ive run across so far that doesnt add fillers and other sugars to their stevia i love sweetleaf steviabr br maltodextrin is a processed hydrolyzed starch used as a filler by a lot of companies my question is whybr br there are a couple of other sugars they like to add too stevia is great all by itself it seems as though theyre determined to muck up a very healthy thing sigh
5: i switched to this whole herb concentrate because i didnt like the idea of a super refined white product that was missing all of the plants other constituents and medicinal properties  i use it every day in my smoothies  blended with yogurt or coconut milk and vanilla i find it hard to distinguish from sugar  in other recipes i find it sometimes useful to mix with a bit of honey to balance the flavor  stevia doesnt lend itself well to baking so i go without in those cases
5: due to the pancreatic issues i have long ago banned white sugar from my diet and searched endlessly for suitable alternatives  finally i narrowed my choices down to four
4: the stevia whole leaf concentrate is a lot darker than its clear counterpart  unlike the clear stevia it imparts a slight taste to whatever you put it in  its not unpleasant  its just different
5: im diabetic and have tried many sugar substitutes and i like stevia the best plus it puts some fiber in your diet  before trying stevia i had mostly used sucralose splenda and drinks and foods sweetened with sucralose but found them to be overly sweet for my taste  i like the level of sweetness in drinks sweetened with stevia much better mainly celestial seasonings productsand in tea or coffee i sweeten myself with the concentrate  highly recommend this
5: this is a nice change from using powdered stevia i find that it is better to use in drinks like tea but please please please if you must sweeten coffee just use raw sugar not that white powdered junk i like to use this to sweeten my oatmeal discovered that a few drops of stevia and a few drops of maple extract in oatmeal tastes pretty darn good my only complaint is that this was shipped very poorly two glass bottles in a large box with two plastic air bags one bottle was broken and had made a huge mess all over the inside of the box luckily the folks at amazon were willing to compensate for the loss
5: instead of sugary soda or artificially sweetened drinks i use two squirts of stevia in my iced tea or homemade lemonade it tastes just like sugar
2: ok i love stevia i am not one of those ppl who find it bitter or off putting that being said i gagged on this product i was excited to try it as ppl said you only needed a couple of drops bull i tried a few drops dropper full 2 dropper fulls eww its dark brown and syrupy it has a weird almost molasses like taste it went ok in my green smoothies i love the stevia clear and packets of this brand of stevia though nunaturals brand just cant be beat i was disappointed to have spent the amount of money on this i wish i was one of the ppl who only needed a couple of drops to find an awesome sweet flavor  i hoped that my tastebuds might adapt it just never happeneddarn
5: ive been using this concentrate to sweeten my tea for years this is the best price for this product the downside was that amazon did not adequately protect the bottles that were shipped via the us postal service all bottles broke amazon did replace the order at no cost advice for amazon  completely bubble wrap the bottles including top and bottom which is where they slip out upon shipping also mark the stuff fragile so the unapoligetic postal workers cant hurt it
5: ive been growing  drying my own stevia for a couple years but when my supply runs out the whole leaf concentrate is my goto  much prefer it over the clear liquids or the powders  i am allergic to many types of sugars and sweeteners but not the pure stevia since surviving breast cancer chemo and radiation treatments several years ago i avoid most of the crap manufacturers add to our food supply and am more vibrantly healthy and energetic for it  i very much appreciate this contains stevia and water period
1: ive been using stevia for several years now until buying this type i had always purchased the clear stevia  i just threw out the rest of the bottle of this brown stevia today i use stevia to sweeten iced tea and the clear works like a charm  the brown however seems to congeal at the bottom and also adds a bit of an off tastebr br id suggest you stick with either the clear stevia or the powder
5: i love this berry mix  everything in the mix tastes so fresh and the blueberries make the mix taste fanstastic  i wish there were more in the package but i eat so much i get to the bottom way too quick  i would recommend this product
5: i bought this product from vitacost  i really enjoyed the fresh healthy flavor  i decided to purchse from amazon because its in bulk thereore cheaper  itsso worht it ive tried a lot  this mix really impressed me  no chocolate to melt in the car
4: i bought this berrynut mix because it looked tasty instead of any percieved benefit in eating organics  very satisfied  the package tears open without a tool and it has a built in zip lock closure that actually works  a good way to recharge while hiking without missing a step  nonsalty  the dried blueberries are tiny but i expect that goes with the drying process and is not a complaint  i would buy them again
2: i was looking forward to trying this mixbut it was disappointing  i could smell that it was rancid and it had mostly sunflower seeds and little of anything else  too bad
5: 90 percent of the time i eat either oatmeal cream of wheat or cream of rice for breakfast i always love to add dried fruit and nuts in i have been making up my own blend for quite a while but i figured i would try this brand because it was all organic and it was composed of all the stuff i love the mostbr br i am so glad i did i look foward to my breakfast even more than before and that is hard to do breakfast is by far my most favorite meal so i make sure it tastes great ededn did a really good job with this blend my only negative is that the packages are small but i am ok with that the price is still good for the product i want to try their other blends but i do plan on getting this again
2: i was looking for a good healthy trail mix and since this stuff had good reviews i thought i would give it a try  it was a onetime only mistakebr br looking at the picture of the package and reading the description it looked like a lot of almonds pumpkin seeds some sunflower seeds and berriesjust like it says  however upon opening the first package all i saw were sunflower seedslots and lots of sunflower seeds  an average handful would be a overwhelming majority of sunflower seeds with some pumpkin seeds maybe 2 almonds a couple of raisins one or two cranberries and id only get a tiny blueberry or two every 34 handfuls  i was really surprised  if i had saw this mix in a clear plastic bag at the grocery store i would think it was bird seedbr br wondering how it got such great reviews i read them something i should have done prior to purchasing  lots of people were saying how much they love it but not really saying anything about what was in the bagbr br as for what was there it was ok  im not sure what dry roasting is but all of the nuts and seeds tasted rawsoft and a bit chewy  ive got nothing against raw nuts but since the description says roasted i expected nice crisp almonds and seeds  not the casebr br if organic is your thing then im sure you might like this mix for what it is  it is healthy as well  however i am sticking with my back to nature marthas vineyard blend trail mixits as cheap or cheaper if you get it at the right time fresh with lots of big chewy cherries and cranberriesbr br if you look at the bag of the back to nature mixes it is clear and shows you exactly what you are getting  i am guessing there is a reason the eden mix doesnt come in a clear bag
5: this is a fantastic lowsodium lowsugar snack  it tastes better than most trail mixes and has healthier ingredients like sunflower seeds  i usually eat some before going to the gym because it has a bunch of protein and just a little bit of carbsbr br the packages are very small compared to some trail mix  but because it is organic this mix still represents a good value for the price  the little resealable bags are handy for keeping the mix fresh
5: this mix has everything that i want and none of what i dont want most mixes have too much salt in them for me i like the unsalted ones so that i can add a little bit if i want
3: i was a bit disappointed when i received these  im only glad i paid the subscription price and not the regular price  the individual bags themselves are pretty small  i had never had this mix before  it is difficult to eat since the pieces are so small  especially the blueberries and sunflower seeds  and this mix definitely has a lot of sunflower seeds  will probably not buy again as there are other nutberry mixes i like much better
5: there are a lot of almonds pumpkin seeds and nuts in this snack mix which is so nice since typically trail mixes are heavy on cheap nuts like peanuts and too many raisins  this is a good and hearty snack mix with plenty of dried blueberries  my favorite part of the mix so many trail mixes are mostly full of raisins  but this mix has a generous amount of berries and good quality organic nuts  it is a great price and i put it on my subscribe and save listbr br   i use this mix as a base for cookie dough  a great short cut for cookie bakingbr br   i love all products made by eden natural foods  this company was a pionner in the beginning days of the organic food industry  founded in the late 1960s forgot exact date ooops by michael potter  ive been eating 100 organic since 1969 and it i so unfortunate 95 of big national organic food companies have been sold to pillsbury kraft general mills kellogg  odwalla juice is owned by coca cola naked juice owned by kraft a very long list and the saddest one is burts bees was sold to clorox ugh  eden is one of the very few big national organic food companies which refused to sell out to huge corporations which make junk food  i admire the integrity of eden foods and have been a customer since they were founded a zillion years agobr br   check out eden brand dried montmorency organic dried cherries  phenomenal  plus they make montmorency organic jam spread and eden cherry juice  unfiltered and very intense flavor which is so rich i dilute it with some spring water  michigan is known as growing the best cherries in america if not the world  and eden foods is in clinton michigan so the crop is harvested and then turned into product quickly  exceptionally good flavor
4: wow these are awesome they are a little expensive for what you get but they are pretty good for a snack of something very very healthy
5: i was looking for a healthy trail mix and this product was recommended by a fitness trainer  in addition ive also learned the makers of this product go above and beyond the usda standards of organic labeling  i have placed my 2nd order actually have this on auto ship and am looking forward to its arrival  this is by far the healthiest trail mix i have found  its full of wonderful surprises and is incredibly palatable  i often share this product with my friends and now several of them are on hooked on it as well
5: nice to have these organic berry mix  my kids love them and they are a healthy snack  i give them at their lunch for an extra energy fiber treat
5: excellent quality and flavor  very surprised with the taste and a great snack  for family while traveling  school or office
5: yum thankfully these came in a pack of five because they are really goodbr br yes the packages seem small but they are filled well they have the right mix of fruit to nut ratio they dont have added salt or anything so you are tasting the nuts and the dried fruits  nothing elsebr br i have these on subscribe and save and happily await my next deliverybr br if you are looking for a healthy sweet nutty yummy crunchy snack these are for you
5: this was delicious  i wish there was more in the shipment  my kids and friends at the pool eat it up
5: this snack mix is great  it is full of flavor and good things  i was really needing a snack that had some sweetness to it without any added sugar  this definitely fits the bill  very good  love the package size too as it fits in my purse  i always keep a bag of it along for when i get hungry
5: this mix is very good  the taste is outstanding and it is made with great ingredients  i am very glad it is on amazon subscribe and save so i can have automatic shipments because this has now become a staple of my snack habits at work
5: this makes a great healthy snack no nonsense additives or preservatives no refined sugar and no salt just pure deliciousness eat it straight or mix it with yogurt or cereal its delicious either waybr br get this mix and not the one covered with salt lightly sprayed they claim  tis unfortunately not so
5: i was sort of skeptical about ordering food on amazon but it turns out these snacks are amazing i agree with others here the blueberries in the mix really are great id recommended them to anyone whos looking for that extra item to stuff into their lunch box for a mid day snack
1: stale and cant be returned ive had good luck in the past ordering eden dried fruits online but i knew ordering anything with nuts in the mix was a gamble and i was rightit was a gamble i lost no returns stale never again
5: eden organics provide a great variety of easy to store snacks for the car work desk hiking trips etc  we think amazon sells them at a reasonable price as wellfor having food delivered to your door
1: i cant find the usda organic seal of approval anywhere on the packages though the product claims to be organic
1: my god how can you like this crap dried out tasteless and sickening  would not feed this stuff to a bird or any other form of wildlife for fear of a massive reprisal would not want to get pecked to death  this is the only time in my amazon history i ask for my money back ugg
5: timely arrival  the product is first class  i have been unable to find a supplier in austin tx  other internet offers are much more expensive
1: i was attempting to fill a family members christmas request for gourmet brand of dark chocolate covered raisins  i agreed to pay a standard shipping charge of almost 50  the product arrived in 6 days in a usps standard envelope that was badly torn by our postal service  the raisins however were sealed in a clear plastic bag that had not been torn so i concluded they were sanitary  they looked like large juicy raisins covered by a smooth coating of very dark chocolate  there was no documentation whatsoever except the amazon shipping label since i couldnt just wrap a flimsy plastic bag that was supposed to pass as a gourmet product i went out and got a fancy container that cost almost as much as the raisins  unfortunately the container was too small to hold the entire 2 lbs of raisin  my solution was to open the plastic and fill the container using about 90 of the raisins  i wrapped the gift and it now sits under the treebr br now what do you do with the left over raisins  at least my trouble was to be rewarded by getting to taste the product the chocolate was delicious so was the caramel on the inside  the problem was that they werent any raisins at all  i was all chocolate and caramel  anyway it makes for a good story  im just not sure that i would buy from marich again
1: this used to be a delicious and healthy product until peelu changed the formula  now the gum starts disintegrating when first chewed all the flavor disappears almost immediately and then it turns into a tasteless hard lump  in addition the healthy ingredient xylitol which used to be 100 has been partially replaced with rebiana a possibly unhealthy sugar substitute  i can only hope that peelu will one day go back to the original formula i would never again purchase it otherwise and would certainly not recommend it
4: after eating just pop a few of these and you are set for the next time you brush the great spearminty flavor is an added bonus that lasts surprisingly long
5: this gum is refreshing and lasts a long time  i also like that it doesnt contain all of the artificial flavorings that many big brand gums have  one piece is all it takes
4: i have been taught my italian familys recipe for gravy what i used to call spaghetti sauce the recipe includes tomato sauce crushed tomatoes a little wine garlic some italian herbsand tomato paste put it all together and it is a tasy topping for pasta the family favorite is linguini but we also use it over tortellini penne farfalle fusilli and raviolibr br the contadina tomate paste with italian herbs is one of the key components of this gravy
5: this is truly a great fresh tasting product you should order 4lbs at least cause it will go fast it keeps forever in the freezer i cut it into smaller portions and keep one in the fridge at all times good as whitebread sandwich the price will surprise you
4: when coffee prices were going up and down every other week we decided to try this blend of coffeenot bad at all for the pricenot real bitter and had some decent strengthmy taste buds arent what they used to be so i cannot give you a conniesewers point of view but it works for me
5: i am a daily drinker of coffee i put 34 scoops per day local sales are for 1099 a canister  people hoard fight and snatch up all that they can when they see if for that price  this is cheaper and i dont have to get into a scuffle to buy it  product is fresh within sell by date i bought 2 sets
5: what can i say no more lugging coffee from the store for me this roast brewed in my drip machine starts my day every day just find the strength you like in your coffee maker i add flavors and they are very smooth with this blend all this and amazons auto delivery one can not go wrong thank you dm
5: i was a little worried that i was wasting my money buying coffee at this price so im surprised at the good rich taste  you could say it has a rich taste for a low price
5: the deal on this coffee was really great wish i had ordered 4 more at that price with the price of coffee in the grocery storesthe prices were good on this item
5: maxwell house coffee  great aroma with an excellent taste that perks me up less expensive than in the local store and delivered to my front door with no shipping cost
5: i love the taste of this coffee  i am not a coffee connoisseur but this coffee not bitter and very smooth w great flavor
5: i made  maxwell house coffee this morning and the taste was really good the price is the best barging that i know the package came so fast at free shipping rate
5: as the price of coffee has soared recently i looked for a cheaper version this is pretty good coffee kind of mild for my taste but i just perc it longer and add a touch of cinnamon and its greatbr if you recycle the coffee cans into other projects be aware that this coffee comes in a cardboard tube look alike not a metal can
5: good price and tastes great  i had never tried a wakeup roast before but it has a good flavor and the price was way better than my local grocery store
5: as long as this is available i will continue to buy this great price love the subscribe and save feature
4: this is a good value pound per pound compared to the folgers that i usually buy it tastes smoother than folgers with none of the acidy feeling and slight queasiness that i can get from drinking too much coffee a milder blend with good taste would be my summary
4: its actually mighty fine coffee the only thing that is not mighty fine is the price i paid just 1500 for two 345 ounce containers of this coffee a few months ago and the cost included free shipping from amazon now the price is twice that what happened i want my cheap coffee back amazon as far as the coffee goes no it is not going to win any coffeephile awards this coffee is great for what it is
1: this is the worst coffee i have ever bought would never buy againbr great price from amazon not worth the money
4: the only difference in my purchase of this produce from amazon rather than frombr my local store is that i do not have to carry it in from the car and the primebr time shipping does create enough decrease in the cost per pound that i see it asbr a convenient and economical choice of purchase
1: wasnt happy with this purchase coffee was completly stale i guess thats why they price was good but wont purchase again
